Rahul Gandhi’s chat with Raghuram Rajan makes it look like Congress doesn’t have solutions  Rahul Gandhi chose to ask questions of Raghuram Rajan instead of providing answers. It’s hard to imagine any opposition leader anywhere choosing such optics.  02 May 2020, 03:00 by TN Ninan  Any government needs a good opposition — to act as a check by presenting the threat of an alternative. For the last six years, India has not had one. The regional parties have been marginalised, coerced into silence or bought over, and the Congress has had poor leadership from Rahul Gandhi. His mother, also his predecessor and successor as party president, appears to be preparing the ground for his return by side-stepping one set of aging, unelectable advisors to appoint another, younger set of the same. And so Gandhi, like Robert Bruce’s spider, may try yet again to project himself as a serious, thinking politician. But, as in the 2019 and 2014 election campaigns, are he and his party misfiring again?  As a backdrop, the prime minister’s ratings in a couple of opinion polls (assumed to be reliable) have soared to unimagined levels. Many country leaders elsewhere have also seen a bump in their ratings in recent weeks, as did Donald Trump too until very recently, but none of them on the scale seen for Narendra Modi. Only George W. Bush enjoyed something similar, immediately after 9/11. People tend to rally round the flag during crises, but the imbalance between Modi and the rest is extraordinary. That is not entirely Gandhi’s fault; Modi’s skills as a politician devoted to image-building and to presenting failures as successes are formidable. Nevertheless, as Modi approaches the first anniversary of his second government, what price a good opposition in the foreseeable future?    Also read:   Modi had trapped himself in a corner, then coronavirus arrived to save the day for him     Take a look at Gandhi’s two video performances recently. His press conference, conducted remotely, has been trolled for repeated use of the word “strategic” (and its variants), but his reasoned attack on the government’s “strategy” for tackling Covid-19 was easily countered: Increased testing has not raised the percentage of positive results, the government has already become “strategically” selective by demarcating red, orange and green zones, and the recovery rate has improved while the death rate remains low. There could be a second wave of infections after the “pause” of the lockdown, as Gandhi has warned, but we have to wait for that to happen.  Gandhi’s second video outing saw him in conversation with Raghuram Rajan, with Gandhi asking most of the questions and Rajan responding. This was an odd position in which to place the putative leader of the largest opposition party, as someone seeking wisdom rather than providing answers or solutions. Rajan has been an informal advisor to Gandhi for some time, but a leader does not present himself publicly in a shishya – guru relationship. It is hard to imagine the leader of the opposition in any other large democracy choosing such optics.    Also read:   Is Raghuram Rajan a well-meaning economist or partisan critic?     As for the Congress, it scored an own goal by criticising the government’s decision to temporarily freeze dearness allowance payments to government employees. The party runs the government in Rajasthan, and is a coalition partner in Maharashtra; both state governments have announced pay cuts. And Manmohan Singh (who voiced the party’s criticism on the DA freeze) forgot that he was chief economic advisor back in 1974, when Indira Gandhi froze half of DA increases and placed them in compulsory savings that would be fully reimbursed only over six years.  The real problem, though, is that the Congress leadership shows its privileged bias by voicing its opposition in English, to a relatively minuscule audience, while Modi speaks in a mass idiom in Hindi. Jairam Ramesh, Shashi Tharoor, and others like them (including a senior leader like P. Chidambaram) may come up with sharp arguments and valid criticisms, but on the political battleground, they are snipers, not the cavalry or artillery. And Mohua Moitra shows Priyanka Gandhi what she decidedly is not.  If the Congress is to score even with the English-speaking, middle-class audience, it has to come up with answers that make sense when everyone can see that government revenue has sharply eroded. If businesses are to survive in a dramatic recession, they have to lower fixed costs, like wages. Is it asking too much of the Congress to offer criticisms and realistic solutions that recognise such realities?   Also read:       ThePrint is now on Telegram .

"'Going to be safe' - NASCAR outlines safety measures to race  02 May 2020, 03:06 by AP  CHARLOTTE: NASCAR has put together a safety plan it believes will allow racing to resume. The stock car series plans to do it without spectators, tight social distancing regulations and only essential personnel.  ""We're an outdoor sport, we do have drivers with helmets, we are in race cars,'' said NASCAR executive Steve O'Donnell . ""There are some unique things about our sport that we did feel like provided us the opportunity to get back if we could, where we knew we were going to be safe.""  The series will not be testing for the new coronavirus and a test won't be required to make the roster list to enter the facilities in Darlington, South Carolina, and Concord, North Carolina. Still, there are strong health guidelines in place:      News in Brief    Explore Briefs   Teams are asked to self monitor all employees who will be on their roster lists for five days before they arrive. They must also complete a questionnaire and will be temperature checked at the track. Cloth face masks will be required for everyone in the infield and the entire facility will be used for spacing, meanings one series will use all the garages and motorhomes will be spread throughout the infield.  Temperatures will be randomly taken throughout the event. Symptomatic patients will be removed and given medical attention if needed. Exiting after a race will be staggered, with more random temperature checks. Teams are being asked to disinfect as needed and haulers might be sealed to prevent them from being opened between shop and track.     Pit road crew members will wear a fireproof sock mask that will go from their nose to below the chin or they can wear a face screen from above the eyes to below the chin. Spotters will be spaced around the speedways.  NASCAR is asking teams and participants to contact trace and keep a log of people they have been in contact with. It will provide the ability to notify those needed to isolate for 14 days because they'd been in contact with someone who had tested positive. NASCAR said it was working on tracing software."	News
"FIA warns championships against post-pandemic 'turf wars'  02 May 2020, 03:24 by Reuters  LONDON: Motor racing 's world governing body has warned its various championships against waging 'turf wars' in rearranging their calendars once the COVID-19 pandemic subsides.  Formula One, the world rally and endurance championships and a swathe of other national and continental series are on hold and looking at cramming races into the second half of the year to complete their seasons.  That could lead to overlap and television scheduling clashes.  ""It’s crucial that we prioritise the staging of events,"" International Automobile Federation ( FIA ) deputy president for sport Graham Stoker said in the latest edition of the body's journal AUTO.   News in Brief    Explore Briefs   ""What would be counter-productive would be to get involved in turf wars. Let’s not get involved in disputes about who has got which slot and what prior agreements might specify -- that approach will not work.     ""The main priority is (to) get motor sport going again and if that means some ‘super weekends’ with multiple events happening, in co-operation and with flexibility, well, why not?,"" added the Briton.  Formula One has yet to start a season that had been due to get under way in Australia on March 15.  It is hoping to schedule 15-18 races between July and December, starting in Austria and ending in Abu Dhabi.     It has also cancelled the traditional three-week August factory shutdown to reschedule a string of postponed grands prix.  The Le Mans 24 Hours endurance race, which attracted a crowd of 252,000 last year to the French circuit, has been postponed from June 13-14 to Sept. 19-20 -- a weekend which does not currently clash with F1.  Stoker said it was important to get grassroots events, ""the lifeblood of competition"", and national series up and running to rebuild confidence.  He said the re-emergence of motorsport after both World Wars was driven by a grassroots desire to compete and it may be necessary to start from the bottom up again in a difficult financial landscape with carmakers suffering a slump in sales.  ""Motor sport has got to pull together, and we’ve got to have flexibility in terms of events and venues and thinking outside the box in order to get things going again in a spectacular way that will obviously attract public interest,"" said Stoker.  ""We should also demonstrate that motor sport remains relevant and a positive influence, through its messaging and actions."""	News
'I got to a really dark place that I didn't even know I was in': Ex-All Black Ben Atiga and former Fijian stars open up on mental health struggles  02 May 2020, 04:59 by https://www.rugbypass.com/contributors/online-editor  Pacific Rugby Players Welfare boss and former Samoa international Dan Leo has released the next episode in his Oceans Apart series, focusing on the mental health struggles faces by Pacific players worldwide.  ADVERTISEMENT  After having already released episodes about former Fiji star Rupeni Caucaunibuca and Samoan cult hero Trevor Leota , Leo speaks to a raft of former internationals about their experiences with mental health issues.  The episode comes in the midst of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, where mental health concerns have been exacerbated as people around the globe have been forced to isolate from the outside world in a bid to combat the virus.        The RugbyPass Wrap Up  As highlighted in this episode, these issues are particularly prevalent for Pacific players playing professionally abroad.  Leo, who was capped 42 times by Samoa between 2005 and 2014, uses this episode to explore how mental health has impacted Pacific players from years gone by.  One-cap All Blacks utility back Ben Atiga, former Fiji captain Netani Talei, ex-Fiji hooker Sunia Koto and 2016 Olympic champion Fiji sevens coach Ben Ryan all speak of their experiences with mental health and what can be done to help alleviate the stigma it is often associated with.  Talei explained that the “alpha male” role that Pacific men strive towards and a reluctance to be a burden on others often restricts their ability to ask for help when it’s needed.  ADVERTISEMENT  Koto suggested that becomes even more difficult for Pacific players when they are thrust into a professional rugby environment overseas.  “In the Islands, we are a community-based people, and you are being thrown into an ‘every man for himself’ environment,” the former 59-test front rower told Leo.  “We get a shock. We’re not going to the neighbours house and say ‘Can you help me?'”  Atiga, who made his international debut at the 2003 World Cup, revealed he retired from the game at the age of 25 after struggling to cope with the pressures associated with being an All Black.  ADVERTISEMENT  “I got to a really dark place that I didn’t even know I was in,” the 36-year-old recalled.  “I went to a place where I was doing some really bad things. I was way overweight, about 120kg from paying at 98kg the season before.  “But I woke up and didn’t think anything was wrong. I didn’t even think to go back and play for a long time.  “I had this thought in my head that I’ll go back eventually, I will go back, and when I look back on it now, I didn’t even notice but I was only 25.”  Pacific Rugby Players Welfare is a not-for-profit organisation that works with over 400 Pacific Island rugby players worldwide, providing them the support, advice & skills they need to thrive, both during and after their rugby careers.

UNTWO meets King of Spain, underscores tourism’s importance for COVID-19 recovery  02 May 2020, 04:23 by Chuks Nwanne    Dolphine show at the Ushaka marine World, Durban, South Africa before the lockdown   The Secretary-General of the World Tourism Organization (UNWTO) was recently received by H.M. King Felipe VI of Spain to assess how the COVID-19 pandemic is affecting the tourism sector both nationally and internationally.  The Spanish Head of State was briefed on the global response being led by the UNWTO at the audience, which acknowledged the importance of the tourism sector for economic and social recovery in the face of the pandemic.  During the audience, UNWTO Secretary-General Zurab Pololikashvili stressed the urgency of mustering a coordinated political response at the international level, as well as a real commitment to support tourism, a sector that accounts for 10 per cent of jobs worldwide.  The COVID-19 crisis has coincided with the beginning of the Decade of Action, the countdown to the achievement of the 17 Goals deriving from the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development. Tourism, in particular, has demonstrated its important role in sustainable development, “and that is why it must be part of relief programmes and actions, ensuring that no one is left behind,” said Pololikashvili.  Last January, Pololikashvili presented to the King the Madrid Declaration on Tourism in the 21st Century. This Declaration, the Secretary-General said, “is now more relevant than ever because it emphasizes the resilience of tourism in the most difficult situations”.  According to the UNWTO’s figures, tourism accounts for 12 per cent of the GDP of Spain, which in 2019 received nearly 84 million international tourists, whose expenditure amounted to 80 billion US dollars. In 2018, the country was the world’s number two destination in terms of both tourism arrivals and receipts.  Today, tourism is among the hardest hit sectors due to COVID-19 and its consequences. The UNWTO estimates that international tourist arrivals worldwide this year could fall by as much as 30 per cent, with a corresponding loss of international tourism receipts of up to 450 billion US dollars.  At the same time, the UNWTO recalls that tourism has been a reliable driver of recovery in the wake of past crises, generating wide-ranging benefits that have transcended the sector, reflecting its broad-based economic value chain and deep social footprint.  The Secretary-General expressed his gratitude for the support given to the mandate of the UNWTO, the only United Nations specialized agency headquartered in Spain.  The pandemic “is a challenge for Spain and the rest of the world, but far from defeating us, it will make us stronger as a global society,” he concluded.	News

"Meet the Telford hospital heroes fighting coronavirus on the front line  02 May 2020, 05:05 by Lisa O'Brien   Meet some of the NHS heroes rising to the challenge and fighting coronavirus on the front line in Shropshire.     Clockwise from top left: Estates manager Dave Chan, ward nurse Anupama Suresh, porter Ben Evason, consultant Mei-See Hon, estates worker Derek Jones and cleanliness technician Louise Bleloch   They have described the challenge of fighting Covid-19, saying: “We are a family and we have become bigger and stronger”.  Staff at the Shrewsbury and Telford Hospital NHS Trust are striving to provide outstanding care and save lives every day, despite facing their own anxieties.  They have been forced to react to rapidly changing national guidance, adapt to new ways of working – and today staff at Telford’s Princess Royal Hospital have spoken about what life is really like leading from the front.  The trust, which also runs Royal Shrewsbury Hospital, has seen huge pressure on intensive care beds.  Ashley Timms, who is manager of the intensive therapy and high dependency units , admitted: “We have never faced anything like this before.”    Ashley Timms, ITU ward manager   The 30-year-old from Wem added: “I have felt very emotional at times seeing the dedication, care and compassion for our patients from my team, including our support teams that come to help ITU during this time.  “We have nurses, doctors and clerical workers come from other departments, hospitals and community services to help us. The help they have provided and the teamwork they have demonstrated has been inspirational.  “Our ITU family has become bigger and stronger.  ""I know that I could not be prouder of our cross-site critical care teams and how they have adapted to new ways of working in unprecedented times.”  More Covid-19 coverage:     The NHS heroes leading from the front at Royal Shrewsbury Hospital      Coronavirus deaths in Shropshire and Mid Wales ‘lower than more deprived areas’      Latest number of deaths and confirmed cases in your area      See all the latest coronavirus news at shropshirestar.com/covid19      Star Neighbour: See the support in your area and how you can help     Doctors and nurses at PRH and RSH have been updating families of patients over the phone as much as possible, while they are also showing patients photographs that have been emailed in from family members.  The hospitals also have iPads and cordless phones, so relatives can either video call their loved ones or pass on their messages. Donations, cards and letters from the public have been gratefully received and Mr Timms says there is “excellent team spirit”.  He said: “We are worried for our own families and relatives, this pandemic is testing everyone. I have seen my team come together more than ever, supporting one another and even making one another laugh at break time. We are proud to be part of the critical care team and we will get through this.”  Sophia Hallewell, 30, a medicines management technician in pharmacy, has volunteered to work on the Covid-19 wards.    Sophia Hallewell, medicines management technician   “Others are finding this time hard to cope with and I would rather feel okay about going on the wards than another colleague struggle with anxiety to do it,” she said.  “I personally don’t have to go in with patients with Covid-19, but all the staff I have seen dealing with patients have been doing a great job.  “Some days you can come in feeling ready and other days it’s harder to deal with.  ""We all have a buddy group that we can talk to each other about any worries we have and meet up for a quick chat.”  Senior radiographer Claire Atkinson , 26, of Telford, added: “We all have good days and bad days but we are all supporting each other and helping each other out.    Claire Atkinson, senior radiographer   ""Our department leads have been really good at ensuring that we all have rest days as the shifts can be mentally draining.  ""We are definitely seeing an increase in the number of portable chest X-rays throughout the hospital, including A&E, ITU and the wards. Our CT, MRI, ultrasound and interventional departments are also seeing an increase in inpatient scans.”  Ms Atkinson sees Covid-19 patients daily, performing portable chest X-rays at their bedside or they are brought to her department for other examinations.  She added: “Our role means we have transient contact with patients and rarely interact with families.  “I know that many family members feel at a loss with not being able to be with their loved one every step of the way, but my colleagues on the ward are making constant efforts to keep in touch with the families during a very difficult time.”  Anupama Suresh is a nurse on the stroke rehabilitation ward.    Anupama Suresh, registered nurse   “Our hospital is well prepared for the Covid fight so the only change I’ve felt is the number of hospital visitors, which is now reduced,” she said.  “We all had appropriate training for Covid management as well.  “I have a real mix of feelings right now.  “I am really happy to be in my role as I got the chance to support this nation during the coronavirus pandemic crisis.  “I am also worried about my family in India as they were also in lock down, but I am not worried about myself because I have faith in the healthcare system in England and in God.”  The 32-year-old, of Telford, says there has been adequate staffing so the workload is manageable and morale has been “calm and professional”.  She added: “I am really lucky to have such a wonderful team, all of them are very kind and supportive.  “I am really glad to see a lot of support and appreciation we receive from the public daily in various forms like cards and gifts.”  Clinical director for maternity and consultant obstetrician Mei-See Hon looks after women throughout their pregnancy, labour and birth.    Mei-See Hon, consultant obstetrician   She is proud of how the whole team has responded and says morale is good, but the challenge will be keeping the momentum going and spirits up as time progresses.  “Everyone is really driven to making sure our mums get the best possible birthing experience as we know this is such a special time in their lives,” said the 41-year-old, from Newport.  “For the first few weeks of the pandemic we invested a lot of time planning for what was to come and reconsidering all ways that women access and receive care in order to keep our mums, their families and the staff safe.  “We had to pause the home birth service and births in the midwife-led unit as we saw our staffing levels reduce, with staff following shielding and self-isolating guidance, but I am delighted to say that these services have now been reinstated and we look forward to welcoming new families into our brand new Wrekin midwife-led unit.  “We have been conducting telephone consultations where appropriate so women don’t need to attend in person.  “When women do need to attend the hospital there are strict procedures in place to make sure that we maintain social distancing for them to minimise their risk.”  She has urged mums-to-be to continue to seek help if they have any concerns about their pregnancy.  “We want to be very clear that we are open for business as usual and we really want to make sure that mums who have any concerns contact us; it’s really important, as it has always been, for mums to seek help early.  “If you are worried about your baby’s movements please do not delay getting in touch with maternity triage – we are very much still here for you.”  Meanwhile, Bernadette Cooke manages the neonatal unit , looking after the wellbeing of babies, families and staff.    Bernadette Cooke, neonatal unit manager   The unit hasn’t had any Covid-19 patients, although staff have had to adapt to wearing full protective equipment.  “Families are spoken to daily by the medical team, and our parents are encouraged to continue to care for their babies,” said the 51-year-old, from Shrewsbury.  “We’ve implemented ‘Baby Diary’ – a downloadable app enabling parents and family to receive regular pictures and updates when they are not here.  “We are soon to go live with “V – Create” another platform for videos.  “Our parents have been incredibly understanding about the restricted visiting and wearing of PPE.  “We are living in unprecedented times – the information we are receiving changes daily.  “Our priority is keeping our families updated whilst also being aware of the impact of Covid-19 on staff and their home life.”    A thank you sign next to the hospital from Telford & Wrekin Council workers   She says staff have been pulling together as a team to solve any issues and the trust has set up staff ‘wellbeing rooms’.  Ms Cooke has also paid tribute to her colleagues and the public for their support.  “The public have been generous keeping us supplied with kit bags, scrubs, knitted items, quilts and well wishes – these are all greatly appreciated,” she said.  “My colleagues have been fantastic I am so proud of them.  “My managers, my ward staff and colleagues from other wards are all helping each other to work through this as a team. This huge, wonderful team is full of empathy and support.  “I don’t wish to be called a hero in any way. I come in to work to do the job I love, and care for people. We are all just doing the best we can.”  David Chan, from Telford, manages the operational side of the estates at PRH and has admitted to feeling worried himself during these unprecedented times.    David Chan, estates manager   The 58-year-old and his team have been forced to think differently during the pandemic, which has meant daily briefings and moving wards and staff at very short notice to accommodate Covid-19 patients.  Sourcing some materials has become one of his biggest challenges as some suppliers and service contractors are either shut or running on a bare minimum.  Mr Chan, who has worked for the trust for 33 years, says it is “extremely busy”.  He said: “I have never known it to be this busy in all the years I have worked for the trust, trying to adapt with Covid, plus carry on with normal duties as well.”  But he says support from both the public and colleagues has been fantastic.  He added: “We have two volunteers supporting our admin team and we also have a local electrical contractor working for us on a volunteering basis – plus a local plumber filling in gaps on the on call team.  “We also have some of our suppliers and contractors giving us priority contact so they are at our call 24/7.  “Every Thursday we get appreciated by the public, but I clap every Thursday to appreciate how the public support us.”  Cleanliness technician Louise Bleloch has an important role keeping the hospital clean and safe, while she also stops to chat to patients to lift their spirits.    Louise Bleloch, cleanliness technician   Her job now requires her to wear PPE at all times and, although she feels anxious, she says morale is surprisingly good.  “Staff and patients are lifting each other’s spirits,” she said.  “Our trust’s values have truly shone at this time.  “The public support has been amazing.  “The clapping on a Thursday has shown how all key workers, regardless of where they work, and in what role, are valued.”  Porter Ben Evason has worked at the trust for more than a decade.    Ben Evason, porter   During the pandemic, he’s been involved in the transfer of Covid-19 patients from A&E and to scans if required, as well as taking important samples to the lab for urgent transport and testing.  The 33-year-old, from Telford, said: “The pace of shifts change day to day but as a team we are pulling together and are currently meeting the demands, and are fully resourced.  “Morale is good and porters have been buoyed by the kindness, generosity and support shown by the local community and businesses.  “The public support during this period means a lot.  “Seeing positive messages and signs created by children outside people’s homes, and on the way to work, help.”"	NotNews
Upcoming McRae learning rallying ropes up close and personal  02 May 2020, 05:10 by PETER NJENGA  In Summary   Kimathi made his rallying debut in the 2015 national championship series in Naivasha and got a baptism of fire although he did manage a top 10 position in one of the rally stages  Kimathi also realised speed can be dangerous in the most scary way while still a teen   McRae Kimathi was the youngest driver to finish the 2019 World Rally Championship (WRC) Candidate Event Safari Rally, the most significant motoring event in Africa since 2002.  This event, organised under the supervision of the International Motorsport Federation (FIA) and its commercial rights holder WRC Promoter was the final test for Kenya that led to the readmission of the Safari Rally back to the high profile World Rally Championship (WRC) after an 18 years absence.  Kimathi, navigated by Evans Mwenda in an old Subaru Impreza N12, a car which defined Subaru’s presence in the WRC when Kimathi was only 10, finished 25th in an event which decimated modern day rally machines to notch two achievements of being the youngest driver at 24 in 2019 and youngest ever African driver to conquer the iconic Kenyan classic.  “The Safari is a prestigious event with lots of history and heritage,” said Kimathi, adding that it requires utmost respect and preparation. “It was a WRC Candidate Event in 2019, and I spent a month preparing the car to ensure I was ready for the gruelling three days that we faced.”  Kimathi made his rallying debut in the 2015 national championship series in Naivasha and got a baptism of fire although he did manage a top 10 position in one of the rally stages. From then on his mindset changed. Rallying was a sporting event that demanded discipline, physical and mental fitness.  He also found out that one does not start climbing a tree from the top. First, he needed to work on his reflexes and long term goals.  “I started rallying back in 2015. I did a couple of rallies in and out. Then I realised that I need something more realistic to help me develop to a better driver,” he says.  “With this in mind, I did the full autocross championship in 2017 where I finished second. The next year I ended up third.”  Kimathi also realised speed can be dangerous in the most scary way while still a teen. “It was back when I was 17 years old and full of adrenalin,” he recalled.  “My father had a Subaru Forester and on Sundays, I would take it out for a spin. It was just around the estate. On this particular Sunday, I drove a bit too fast, slid off the road, hit an electricity post, and rolled. It was a pretty nasty accident but thank God I got out without major injuries.”  This incident taught him the need to respect cars and go through the learning curve if he was ever to become a rally driver. Was it a worthy lesson?  “This incident taught me many things. First of all, I discovered where my limit is and the dangers of motorsport,” said the alumnus of Strathmore University business school.

Coronavirus: UAE Cardiac patients warned against delay in seeking medical help  Reluctance to consult a doctor amid COVID-19 fears could prove detrimental  02 May 2020, 05:17 by Samihah Zaman, Staff Reporter  Abu Dhabi: Faced with fears about contracting coronavirus, cardiac patients in the UAE are shying away from seeking medical help, even during emergencies, leading to further complications, doctors have warned.  Speaking to Gulf News, they said patients are seeking medical help as late as four to six days after developing symptoms like chest pain and tightness.     Dr Walid Shaker  “In our most recent case, a 44-year-old patient visited the hospital three days after he had started experiencing chest pain. When we carried out an angiogram, we found that his left main coronary artery had narrowed – a condition that can suddenly become life-threatening,” Dr Walid Shaker, cardiothoracic surgeon at Burjeel Hospital Abu Dhabi, said.  “We understand that people prefer to stay at home at a time like this. But it is essential to consult a doctor in case of certain emergencies, especially cardiac ones. Otherwise, they could be risking their lives,” Dr Shaker said.  Dr Brajesh Mittal, interventional cardiologist at Medcare Hospital, Dubai, said 30 to 35 per cent of patients with acute cardiac emergencies have delayed presentation at the hospital, compared to just 10 to 15 per cent before the coronavirus outbreak.     Dr Brajesh Mittal  “Patients are obviously afraid to contract the virus, so they may be hiding symptoms for as long as possible. But it must be remembered that delays in medical intervention can increase complications, including permanent damage to the heart muscles, while also slowing down recovery,” he added.  As Gulf News reported earlier this month, patients have been delaying medical care since the start of the COVID-19 outbreak, in an attempt to limit any exposure to the virus.  However, certain emergencies require prompt medical attention, and doctors have to intervene even before patients can be tested for COVID-19.  “In all cases, patients experiencing symptoms like chest pain, tightness and increasing breathing difficulties should at least consult their physicians, especially now that telemedicine options are available,” Dr Shaker said.  When patients present to an emergency department with symptoms, they are first tested for COVID-19. But test results become available only after 48 hours or more, but delaying treatment until then can be dangerous.  “Holding off on treatment until we can confirm if a patient has COVID-19, especially one with acute cardiac symptoms in unstable condition, can prove fatal. So we’ve been undertaking surgeries in full protective gear,” Dr Shaker said.    Surgical team at Burjeel Hospital in Abu Dhabi prepare to operate on a patient with a cardiac emergency Image Credit: Supplied   Over the last month, the surgeon and his team have performed about five surgeries while donning full personal protective equipment, including hazmat suits, N95 masks, as well as surgical gowns for surgeons, assistant surgeons and scrub nurses.  “It is difficult, especially as procedures can last up to six hours, but this is the only way to keep patients and surgical teams safe,” Dr Shaker explained.  According to Dr Mittal, other precautionary measures are also important.  “We minimise the number of medical staff in the cath lab, and only allow cleaning staff to sterilise it after an hour following a procedure,” he said.  The doctor has carried out four emergency cardiac procedures over the last month.  Experts around the world have also observed a 40 per cent reduction in the presentation of cardiac emergencies at healthcare facilities.  “It could be because fewer people are facing myocardial emergencies, perhaps as a result of being largely at home and facing somewhat less stress, or because they are eating healthier. But this trend is not yet fully understood,” Dr Mittal said.	News
N Korean leader Kim Jong Un appears in public for 1st time in 20 days  02 May 2020, 05:00 by ED JONES  SEOUL — North Korean leader Kim Jong Un made his first public appearance in 20 days as he celebrated the completion of a fertilizer factory near Pyongyang, state media said Saturday, ending an absence that had triggered global rumors that he may be seriously ill.  The North’s official Korean Central News Agency reported that Kim attended the ceremony Friday in Sunchon with other senior officials, including his sister Kim Yo Jong, who many analysts predict would take over if her brother is suddenly unable to rule.  The official Rodong Sinmun newspaper published several photos of Kim wearing black and smiling as he looked around the factory and cut a red ribbon, his sister looking from behind.  One of the photos showed him smiling and clapping with his sister and other senior officials under a sign that read “Sunchon Phosphatic Fertilizer Factory: Completion Ceremony: May 1, 2020.” Seemingly thousands of workers, many of them masked, stood in lines at the massive complex, releasing balloons into the air.  The images gave no clear sign that Kim was in discomfort. He wasn’t seen with a walking stick, like the one he used in 2014 when he was recovering from a presumed ankle surgery. However, one of the photos at the factory showed a green electric cart, which appeared similar to a vehicle he used in 2014.  It was Kim’s first public appearance since April 11, when he presided over a ruling Workers’ Party meeting to discuss the coronavirus and reappoint his sister as an alternate member of the powerful decision-making Political Bureau of the party’s Central Committee. That move confirmed her substantial role in the government.  Speculation about his health swirled after he missed the April 15 birthday celebration for his late grandfather Kim Il Sung, the country’s most important holiday, for the first time since taking power in 2011.  The possibility of high-level instability raised troubling questions about the future of the secretive, nuclear-armed state that has been steadily building an arsenal meant to threaten the U.S. mainland while diplomacy between Kim and President Donald Trump has stalled.  Some experts say South Korea, as well as its regional neighbors and ally Washington, must begin preparing for the possible chaos that could come if Kim is sidelined by health problems or even dies. Worst-case scenarios include North Korean refugees flooding South Korea or China or military hard-liners letting loose nuclear weapons.  “The world is largely unprepared for instability in North Korea,” said Leif-Eric Easley, a professor at Ewha University in Seoul. “Washington, Seoul and Tokyo need tighter coordination on contingency plans while international organizations need more resources and less controversy over the role of China.”  South Korea’s Unification Ministry, which deals with inter-Korean affairs, confirmed Kim’s visit to the fertilizer factory and said it was part of his efforts to emphasize economic development. The ministry called for discretion on information related to North Korea, saying that the “groundless” rumors of past weeks have caused “unnecessary confusion and cost” for South Korea’s society and financial markets.  South Korea’s government, which has a mixed record of tracking Pyongyang’s ruling elite, repeatedly downplayed speculation that Kim, believed to be 36, was in poor health following surgery.  The office of President Moon Jae-in said it detected no unusual signs in North Korea or any emergency reaction by its ruling party, military and cabinet. Seoul said it believed Kim was still managing state affairs but staying at an unspecified location outside Pyongyang.  The KCNA said workers at the fertilizer factory broke into “thunderous cheers” for Kim, who it said is guiding the nation in a struggle to build a self-reliant economy in the face of “head wind” by “hostile forces.”  The report didn’t mention any direct comment toward Washington or Seoul.  Speaking to reporters at the White House, Trump declined to comment about Kim’s reappearance but said he would “have something to say about it at the appropriate time.”  State media reported Kim was carrying out routine activities outside public view, such as sending greetings to the leaders of Syria, Cuba and South Africa and expressing gratitude to workers building tourist facilities in the coastal town of Wonsan, where some speculated he was staying.  It wasn’t immediately clear what caused Kim’s absence in past weeks. In 2014, Kim vanished from the public eye for nearly six weeks and then reappeared with a cane. South Korea’s spy agency said he had a cyst removed from his ankle.  Analysts say his health could become an increasing factor in years ahead: he’s overweight, smokes and drinks, and has a family history of heart issues.  If he’s suddenly unable to rule, some analysts said his sister would be installed as leader to continue Pyongyang’s heredity dynasty that began after World War II.  But others question whether core members of North Korea’s elite, mostly men in their 60s or 70s, would find it hard to accept a young and untested female leader who lacks military credentials. Some predict a collective leadership or violent power struggles.  Following an unusually provocative run in missile and nuclear tests in 2017, Kim used the Winter Olympics in South Korea to initiate negotiations with Washington and Seoul in 2018. That led to a surprising series of summits, including three between Kim and Trump.  But negotiations have faltered in past months over disagreements in exchanging sanctions relief and disarmament steps, which raised doubts about whether Kim would ever fully deal away an arsenal he likely sees as his strongest guarantee of survival.  Kim entered 2020 vowing to build up his nuclear stockpile and defeat sanctions through economic “self-reliance.” Some experts say the North’s self-imposed lockdown amid the coronavirus crisis could potentially hamper his ability to mobilize people for labor.  © 2020 The Associated Press.

US expands military base in northeast Syria as reinforcements enter from Iraq: video  02 May 2020, 20:11 by News Desk  BEIRUT, LEBANON (11:00 P.M.) – The U.S. military is expanding their base in the Al-Hasakah Governorate, the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights (SOHR) reported on Saturday.  Citing local sources, the monitor reported that the U.S. military is expanding their base in the Istrahat Wazir area of the Al-Hasakah Governorate.  The monitor released several pictures from the site, showing the expansion by the U.S. Coalition forces.  At the same time, the SOHR reported that as many as 30 trucks from the U.S. Coalition entered northeastern Syria from neighboring Iraq.  While not much detail was given, the U.S. Coalition forces likely entered Al-Hasakah from the Al-Walid Crossing, which the Syrian government deems illegal.  The monitor released a video showing the U.S. convoy as it traveled to one of its bases in the Al-Hasakah Governorate.	News
"Military helicopter debris suggests sudden descent, as probe faces challenges: experts  02 May 2020, 20:21 by Michael Tutton The Canadian Press Staff Contact  HALIFAX -- Former senior Canadian Armed Forces officers say it appears a military Cyclone helicopter struck the waters off Greece with sudden and massive velocity, but investigators may face challenges determining what caused the tragedy without recovering the aircraft.  The crash took the lives of six military personnel when it went down Wednesday in the Mediterranean Sea as it was returning to the Halifax-based frigate, HMCS Fredericton.  The Canadian Forces members have been identified as Capt. Brenden Ian MacDonald of New Glasgow, N.S.; Capt. Kevin Hagen of Nanaimo, B.C.; Capt. Maxime Miron-Morin of Trois-Rivieres, Que.; Sub-Lt. Matthew Pyke of Truro, N.S.; Master Cpl. Matthew Cousins of Guelph, Ont.; and Sub-Lieutenant Abbigail Cowbrough, originally from Toronto.  Retired Colonel Larry McWha the former commanding officer of 423 Squadron, which flies CH-148 choppers out of the helicopter base in Shearwater, N.S., says images from the area show the debris field of the crash is not large and the oil slick isn't widely spread out, suggesting a high-speed and violent crash that caused some portions to break off immediately.  He says it's the ocean equivalent of an aircraft crash onto land that leaves ""a smoking, black hole"" at the point of impact.  Ken Hansen, a Halifax-based independent defence analyst and former naval officer, said the crash is puzzling, as sparse details released to date don't give any indicators the crew was aware of a potential problem.  He said sources at 12 Wing Shearwater, the downed helicopter's home base, have told him that the crew was ""a star crew, top-notch people,"" and he says the chances of pilot error are very low.  In addition, Hansen said he was also told that the aircraft's maintenance had recently been ""completely redone"" before the deployment.  ""It's something that would have been done normally for an aircraft going out on a six-month deployment. It was in top condition,"" he said.  The Cyclone has a self-diagnostic maintenance system and Hansen said this can warn operators of issues long before they can be discovered through direct observation.  Like McWha, he said the known debris field indicates the Cyclone hit the water with great force.  ""That means a major event took place, something catastrophic,"" said Hansen.  McWha said from what he knows of the crash, it could prove crucial to recover as much of the helicopter as possible -- a challenging task given the depth of the water in the area.  He notes the aircraft, except for a door and some small pieces, disappeared below the surface and has not been located.  He said he suspects it may have landed on a sloped ocean bottom and gravity may carry it into very deep waters.  McWha says while a flight data recorder and voice recordings may tell investigators some details, they often need portions of the aircraft to discover the causes -- particularly if there was a mechanical failure -- in order to examine the broken part.  For example, when a civilian counterpart of the CH-148 Cyclone crashed off the coast of Newfoundland and Labrador in 2009, resulting in 17 deaths, investigators from the Transportation Safety Board were able to find broken titanium studs to indicate the gearbox oil filter assembly had broken off.  Rear Admiral Craig Baines, the commander of the navy's maritime command, told reporters on Friday that no conclusions can be drawn yet as the military flight investigators haven't yet examined the cockpit voice recorder and the flight data recorder or interviewed HMCS Fredericton crew.  Among the few details revealed, he estimated the crash occurred ""within two miles"" of the frigate, but he didn't indicate how close the helicopter was to ship or how many eye witnesses there were.  The twin-engine Sikorsky CH-148 Cyclone is the military variant of the commercially used Sikorsky S-92.  Hansen, a military analyst, said his sources have told him, ""the aircrew were absolutely thrilled to fly the thing, it was a huge success until this recent setback.""  However, McWha notes that Canada is still awaiting the delivery of 10 of the 28 Cyclones, which were already years behind schedule due to the federal government requiring changes prior to accepting the aircraft.  ""That's because they're still upgrading issues that had to be rectified,"" said McWha.  After scouring the seascape with its NATO allies, the Canadian Forces warship formally ended its search for survivors Friday.  The ship was to dock at an Italian port during the weekend.  ""Repatriation efforts are still being discussed with the families, as they are of course the priority,"" a Canadian Forces spokeswoman said in an email.  ""As you can appreciate, the investigation team are busy with their very important work and it would be too soon to discuss details.""  ""The commander of HMCS Fredericton is also mourning his team, helping the crew through this extremely difficult time, and of course managing the ongoing deployment efforts.""  Baines has said Fredericton's crew would remain in Italy for several days before returning to resume its role in the NATO mission.  -- With files in Halifax from Keith Doucette.   This report by The Canadian Press was first published May 2, 2020."	News
"Yes, David Koresh's Musical Moment During the Siege on Waco Really Did Happen  02 May 2020, 20:10 by Hedy Phillips  When the FBI stormed David Koresh's compound in Waco, TX, in 1993 looking for firearms, what resulted was a 51-day standoff between the authorities and the religious cult that included a lot of negotiation — and music. In the 2018 show Waco , which is based on the real story of the tragedy in Waco , the FBI and ATF (Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms, and Explosives) resorted to blasting music and other annoying sounds at the house to try to get David Koresh (pictured here with Waco survivor Clive Doyle) and his followers to surrender. After they cut the power to the house, Koresh started a generator for just enough time to plug in speakers of his own and play music with his band, aimed right back at the FBI. The question is, how much of that is real?  The real Koresh was indeed a musician. And he did meet David Thibodeau because of music , but it was at a Guitar Center and not a bar during a gig . Koresh did have a band, though, that did play locally, and you can still find his music online .  The FBI also did try to use music and other noise to torment Koresh's group into leaving the house. One of the survivors of the standoff, Clive Doyle, recounted much of the siege in his autobiography. In an excerpt from The New Yorker , Doyle writes that the noise from the FBI was constant and included ""rabbits being killed, warped-up music, Nancy Sinatra singing 'These Boots Are Made For Walking, Tibetan monks chanting, Christmas carols, telephones ringing, reveille."" In retaliation, Koresh sent his own loud music back, though according to a 1993 EW story, Koresh did this before the house's power was cut — not by using a generator like in the show.  As for Koresh's musical retaliation, there are a few different answers as to what he did. EW 's retelling of the siege claims he played tapes of his own songs, but the Los Angeles Times just noted that guitar music blared from inside the compound . However, a transcript from PBS Frontline that included a retelling of the events says that Koresh actually did get out his guitar and play his music . RJ Craig, who was part of the FBI Hostage Team, says in this retelling of the 1993 siege: ""He had his little band in there and, all of a sudden, he starts playing and we were 200-plus yards away and we had to yell at each other to hear. It was . . . and it went on for several hours, this concert, rock concert. Just showing us that his speakers were more powerful than ours.""  In the end, though, Koresh's music and pleading for peace were no match for the authorities, who flooded Mount Carmel with tear gas after 51 days of negotiations, which set the whole place on fire, killing dozens of Koresh's followers and Koresh himself.

"Coronavirus lockdown: India's richest shrine Tirupati Balaji temple fires 1,300 contract workers  02 May 2020, 18:59 by BusinessToday.In   The contract entered into by Tirumala Tirupati Devasthanam (TTD) board, the trust that manages the hill abode of Lord Venkateswara, with the manpower agency which supplied workers ended on April 30   Tirupati Balaji temple in Andhra Pradesh, country's richest Hindu temple of Lord Venkateshwara, has reportedly ousted 1,300 contractual workers amid the coronavirus outbreak. The workers, who were engaged in shrine's sanitation and hospitality work, were asked not to come for duties from May 1, citing the suspension of work due to the nationwide lockdown.  The Tirumala Tirupati Devasthanam (TTD) board, the trust that manages the hill abode of Lord Venkateswara, did not renew the contract, which expired on April 30. YV Subba Reddy, the chairman of the temple's trust, said that the firm supplying the manpower was intimated that their services were discontinued. He, however, assured to look into the issue on humanitarian grounds.  ""The contract entered into by the TTD with the manpower agency which supplied workers ended on April 30. Normally, fresh tenders would have been called by now for awarding of the contract to the agency which bids the lowest amount for manpower supply. Because of the lockdown, the TTD trust board could not meet and finalise the tender,"" TTD official spokesman T Ravi told Hindustan Times.  ""Everything was done as per the rules. Moreover, there is no work for these workers now, because of the lockdown, all guest houses are closed,"" Ravi said.  In view of the nationwide lockdown to curb the spread of COVID-19, the TTD board has imposed a total suspension of darshan for pilgrims in Tirumala temple since March 20. Apart from main temple, 50 sub-temples under the administration of TTD have also been closed.  The board had announced the temple's closure till May 3, following the extension of the nationwide lockdown to contain the spread of coronavirus. The temple's trust is yet to take a call on extension of closure of the shrine as the Centre announced the third phase of the lockdown, beginning May 4.  This is the first time in 128 years that the temple has been closed for pilgrims. The temple with a 2000-year-old history only closed for religious rituals and solar moon eclipses but never for a temporary period."	News
Apple’s $1.5 Billion Headwind Adds FX to Litany of Company Woes  02 May 2020, 11:01 by Maria Elena Vizcaino, Liz McCormick   U.S. companies warn of exchange rates hurting revenue  ‘We’re not able to hedge as much as we normally would’   U.S. multinational companies have begun to feel the sting of a strong dollar on their bottom lines, and there’s no guarantee the pain will go away as economies around the world attempt to reopen.  Dozens of corporations, from Apple Inc. and Facebook Inc. to Harley- Davidson Inc., have warned the dollar’s appreciation is hurting foreign revenue. Even Netflix Inc., which benefited last quarter as much of the world was forced to stay at home, said overseas sales gains from rising subscriptions are being offset by a “sharply stronger” U.S. dollar.  Since the novel coronavirus began spreading in Asia early this year, broad measures of the dollar have surged to records as investors flocked to havens like the greenback and corporations hoarded cash. While the economic fallout poses more acute problems for companies, the headwinds from exchange rates could linger even as business rebounds.  “So let’s suppose we stabilize here or drop 1%,” said Greg Anderson, global head of FX strategy at the Bank of Montreal. “That still leaves U.S. firms facing a big headwind in their attempts to sell U.S.-produced goods overseas. Even if U.S.-based multinationals produce in-country rather than in the U.S., it still still hurts year-over-year earnings after you translate them back into U.S. dollars.”  That hypothetical drop in the trade-weighted dollar would price in improved “global disease dynamics” and a flight away from safety as governments take actions to restore investor confidence, Anderson said. While experts say a second wave of virus infections is inevitable as the world reopens for business, it’s likely to occur later on this year.   Why a Second Wave of Covid-19 Is Already a Worry: QuickTake   The Bloomberg Dollar Spot Index, which tracks the greenback against a basket of global currencies going back to 2005, rose 5.2% in the first quarter this year and ended it about 4.7% above its average level during the same period of 2019. Among the Group-of-10 currencies, the greenback has strengthened versus all but the Japanese yen and the Swiss franc this year.     Both the Bloomberg index and the Fed’s trade-weighted dollar index, which measures the currency versus 26 of America’s biggest trading partners, have inched slightly lower since peaking in March. Yet analysts expect dollar strength to linger, at least for the second quarter. With the deepest recession in generations likely unfolding, governments are introducing fiscal stimulus packages that may weaken their currencies further.  While the currency’s strength is just one of a myriad of stresses that businesses are dealing with, it’s still a material hit to sales for many. Exchange rates knocked 1% off of Apple’s $58.3 billion in sales in the latest quarter, Chief Financial Officer Luca Maestri said on the company’s earnings call . The headwind is expected to grow in the current quarter and reduce revenue by more than $1.5 billion at Apple, which on Thursday joined the growing ranks of companies refraining from providing sales and earnings guidance due to economic uncertainty.  Facebook put the quarterly hit to revenue at $275 million, while Harley-Davidson was dinged for almost $11 million.  ‘Another Residual Problem’  “If it was any other quarter, besides during one amid this pandemic, what the dollar did would be a huge issue,” said Jim Paulsen, chief investment strategist at the Leuthold Group Inc. in Minneapolis. “But now it’s just another residual problem on the list.”  Multinational companies also faced strong currency headwinds in early 2019 after a bout of greenback weakness in the prior year, but the dollar remained mostly range-bound last year so the effect was subsiding.  And while multinationals are often positioned to offset foreign currency volatility with hedges, the sudden strength in the dollar was as unpredictable as the extent of the virus. The widespread depreciation of foreign currencies has caught companies such as Merck & Co. off-guard.  “It’s hitting us across all of our currencies,” Robert Davis, Merck’s chief financial officer, said on an April 28 earnings call. “But importantly, what’s happening as well, and we’re not able to hedge as much as we normally would, is because we are also seeing a material impact in the emerging-market currencies, as well, where we don’t hedge today.”  Each 8% rise in the value of the dollar causes, on average, a 1% hit to corporations’ revenue, according to estimates from Jonathan Golub, chief U.S. equity strategist at Credit Suisse.  “There was a decent strengthening of the dollar over the first quarter,” Golub said. “And it has and will be noticeable to earnings. But the real issue, for now, is that for some companies there is no business.”	News

UK Alleged to Be Seeking to Cooperate With EU on Healthcare Amid Globally Raging COVID-19  02 May 2020, 16:33 by by Lilia Dergacheva   As Boris Johnson has famously vowed to “fire up” the British economy, promising that his roadmap will cover all social sectors, it appears that healthcare issues might be dealt with jointly with the European bloc, which Britain formally exited on 31 January.   The UK is seeking “something akin to membership” of the EU’s early warning and response system (EWRS), which has played a critical role in coordinating Europe’s response to the coronavirus, as well as to earlier infection outbursts such as the bird flu, The Guardian reported , citing courses. According to an EU insider, the proposed scheme would be “pretty much the same” as membership of the EWRS.  “There was not much appetite from the UK at the beginning”, said the EU source, elaborating on the two sides’ plans, if any, to cooperate on health. “That’s been corrected. They are keen and they are keen to be seen to be keen. Both sides want close cooperation”, the source detailed.  However, healthcare issues were not even mentioned in the government’s written statement to Parliament, except for a reference to pharmaceuticals. The Daily Telegraph earlier reported that No 10 had given a no-go to the Department of Health’s proposal to be part of the EWRS.  A government spokesperson did not respond to a question about whether the UK was seeking a form of membership or participation in the EWRS, but referred to the February negotiating objectives. However, the UK has since seen the onset and the climax of the coronavirus health crisis, which personally affected PM Boris Johnson and a number of senior government officials - something that is understood to have possibly made the authorities change their stance on joint efforts with the EU.  In what appears to be another, albeit indirect, sign of Britain zeroing in on the said type of cooperation with Europe, The Guardian has found that the UK attended all five of the EU’s Health Security Committee meetings on the coronavirus pandemic in April, an absolute attendance record, given that between 17 January and 30 March the UK attended no more than 70% of healthcare gatherings.  In April, officials sat down for discussions on lockdown exit strategies and a joint procurement scheme on therapeutics in intensive care.  Earlier, it was reported that the UK had stayed away from partaking in a few joint programmes spearheaded by the EU to bulk-purchase medical kits expected to come in handy during the pandemic.  For instance, in mid-April, European medics were preparing to receive the first of €1.5 billion worth of personal protective kits as part of a joint procurement scheme. The agreement saw as many as 25 countries and eight companies participate, according to cited internal EU documents.

"New Yorkers venture outside on sunny Saturday, and so do 1,000 cops  02 May 2020, 16:59 by Tom Winter and Minyvonne Burke  As New York City residents ventured outside to enjoy a sunny Saturday, police sent 1,000 officers to ensure they abided by social distancing rules that remain in place to slow the spread of the coronavirus .  ""This is the nicest weather we've seen this year; we encourage people to come out and enjoy this weather,"" Terence Monahan, Chief of Department for the New York Police Department, told NBC News.  But, he reminded residents out enjoying the city's parks, ""You cannot gather; you cannot barbecue. We're going to give you a summons. There's been enough warnings.""  He said the NYPD would have bike teams and mounted units on horseback throughout the parks, as well as aviation units working to spot problem areas.  Monahan said officers will not issue summonses for people who don't have face coverings, but officers will have packs of cloth masks to hand out to those who need them.  He said he hopes his officers won't have to issue any summonses.  ""The vast majority of times people have complied,"" he said. ""But there's been some people who think they can do whatever they want. They endanger my cops; they endanger each other.""  Lt. Adam Mellusi, who regularly commands patrols in the Bronx, is leading a group of a dozen officers on bikes. He said his team was assigned to all of the parks in the five boroughs.  ""If there's large-scale barbecues and drinking, we're going to issue a summons,"" he said, adding that most New Yorkers support the officers' patrolling the parks and have ""actually thanked us for being out here."""

First-class emir dies in Kano  02 May 2020, 16:45 by TheCable   Tafida Abubakar Ila, emir of Rano,  has died one day after he was admitted to the hospital over an unknown ailment.   Fatihu Bichi, his media aide confirmed this to TheCable, saying he died on Saturday evening.  Bichi said Abubakar fell ill on Friday and was taken to the Aminu Kano Teaching Hospital but was referred to Nassarawa Specialist Hospital due to lack of oxygen.  Rano is one of the emirates created by Abdullahi Ganduje, governor of Kano, at the height of his rift with Muhammadu Sanusi, whom he eventually deposed as the emir of Kano.  The real cause of the emir’s death is unknown but it happened at a time when the state is battling unusual deaths.  Kano has been hit by a wave of deaths since it recorded its index COVID-19 case in April.  Sabitu Shuaibu, deputy coordinator of the task force on COVID-19, had reportedly said 640 persons died in the state within one week.  The spike in deaths had made many residents panic, with rumours making the rounds that they are from COVID-19 complications.  But the government dismissed the rumour, attributing the deaths to diabetes, malaria and hypertension.  President Muhammadu Buhari had ordered a two-week lockdown and a probe of the deaths.  The Kano state government and the Nigeria Centre for Disease Control (NCDC) later decided on verbal autopsy to ascertain the cause of the unusual deaths.  Verbal autopsy is a method of gathering information about symptoms and circumstances that led to the death of an individual in order to determine the probable cause of death in cases where there was no medical record or formal medical attention given.  According to a survey seen by TheCable , 41.3 percent of those who died in Kano during this period had fever — one of the symptoms of COVID-19.  Yusuf Yau Gambo, a lecturer at the department of mathematics, Yusuf Maitama Sule University in Kano, carried out a “community-based survey on reported increased mortality in Kano state,” giving “possible explanations with data”.  Gambo, an applied mathematician and data analyst, stated that the report, which has received attention from Kano COVID-19 task force, is an attempt to provide timely intervention to understand the situation and to halt false narratives.  The survey is based on a very small sample size of 260 households from over 17 local government areas.  Nasiru Gwarzo, head of the COVID-19 task force in Kano, says there is now a high rate of community transmission of the disease in the state.  Gwarzo told the BBC Hausa that a high rate of transmission, as shown by increased testing, is currently evident when compared to the former situation.  He said unlike before, about 80 percent of the samples received from communities in the state turned out positive for COVID-19.  Kano, which recorded its first case of the disease about three weeks ago, now has 311 confirmed cases, making it the second worst-hit state.	News

Men should share home chores with wives – Actor Akah Nnani  02 May 2020, 10:59 by Sanya Agunbiade  Actor Akah Nnani has said men should also take part in chores in the home and not leaving every activity in the home for their wives to carry out.    Men should share home chores with wives – Actor Akah Nnani   Taking to his Instagram page, the actor wrote that it is time for gender equality in the home as well as it is an all-round responsibility of the man to take care of his household and protect them from invaders  of any sort.     He wrote;  I believe a man’s responsibility is to protect the woman, his wife, from stress. In these times, fathers are to protect their kids from germs. Help your kids wash their hands. Protect your family from the social damage of having an absent father. We always talk about ‘wife material’ well, there should be #HusbandMaterial too then. We live in a world where women are unfairly burdened with the responsibility of caring for the home alone. They cook, clean, take care of the kids and all sorts… Then still have to do work. I’ve been married for over a year now and before marriage, I always knew I didn’t want domestic help. In my home, when she cooks I wash the bathroom, she sweeps, I mop. She is tired, I make the indomie. I wash the dishes. I also keep MY home. Because it is mine too. I know men can do better when we know better. This is why I am joining the #HeForShe campaign to remind my brothers that #GenderEquality should also be at home. Oh, the world would be so much better and we would be so much happier if we worked together to make every human feel valued.

A YouTuber tricked celebrities into thinking they were appearing on 'The Late Late Show with James Corden'  02 May 2020, 19:06 by Lindsay Dodgson      The Late Late Show With Josh Pieters and Archie Manners. Josh Pieters / YouTube    YouTuber Josh Pieters tricked celebrities into thinking they were appearing on “The Late Late Show with James Corden” via a video chat in his latest social experiment .  Thanks to celebrities now being more available than ever for video calls, he could pretend to be Corden using just a few voice clips.  UK pop star Craig David and TikToker Holly H both thought they were talking to Corden in the first video that was posted on Friday, while being chaperoned by the show’s producer (played convincingly by Pieters’ sidekick Archie Manners).  In the second video that went live on Saturday, influencers Molly-Mae and Tommy Fury from “Love Island” spoke to the fake Corden, as did magician Julius Dein.  The grand finale will be posted on Sunday.  Visit Insider’s homepage for more stories .    YouTuber Josh Pieters has had to be inventive when coming up with his social experiments during lockdown in the UK, as everything, from formulating the plan to setting it in motion, has to be done from his home in London.  However, thanks to the sudden boom in video calling, he managed to convince celebrities they were appearing on “The Late Late Show with James Corden.”  Pieters scraped many of Corden’s old interviews and video segments for sound bites and collected enough to make one side of a believable conversation. There was obviously no video feed, but the guests were told they would be chaperoned by the show’s producer, who was convincingly played by Pieters’ friend and sidekick Archie Manners .  Celebrities and their managers were none the wiser, as so many late night show hosts have been doing interviews from their own homes.     In the first of three videos in the series, British pop star Craig David and the UK’s biggest TikTok star Holly Hubert, who goes by Holly H , were interviewed. While Pieters took care of the voice notes to try and come up with a coherent flow of conversation, Manners kept things moving in his own flat across town, with the help of an imaginary assistant named “Sharon.”  They were also treated to exclusive performances. David sang one of his biggest hits, “Rise and Fall,” while Hubert demonstrated the viral TikTok dance the Renegade.  “As you know, the ‘Late Late Show with James Corden’ is on TV every night, so it’s only right that our show does the same,” Pieters said at the end of the video.  The second video featured Molly-Mae and Tommy Fury from “Love Island” and magician Julius Dein, and was posted on Saturday.  Dein sneaked in a flogging attempt for his magic box, while the couple were asked how they were getting on in quarantine.  The grand finale will air on Sunday, which you will definitely want to tune in for.   Watch the full first video below.

Heineken sues over 15,000 cases of frozen beer  02 May 2020, 21:02 by Kathianne Boniello  Frozen margaritas are one thing — but frozen beer is bad for business, according to Heineken, which claims it lost more than 15,000 cases of brew to frigid temps when a shipping company mishandled them.  The suds were shipped to the United States from Amsterdam last year, were offloaded in the Port of Newark, and then sent to Satellite Logistics Group in the Chicago suburbs, according to a lawsuit filed last month.  But Satellite Logistics allegedly failed to immediately put the 11 shipping containers of brew in a climate-controlled facility, leaving it in below-zero temperatures for several days, Heineken charges in Manhattan Federal Court papers.  The “extreme temperature abuse” changed the taste of the beer, which had to be trashed, Heineken claimed.  Heineken is seeking more than $234,000 in damages.  Heineken was seeking more than $234,000 in damages, but says the case was resolved.	News

With that in mind, this article will attempt to, briefly, consider, examine, review, and discuss, 7 things, which may change, forever.  1. Malls: What will happen to malls, and the larger stores, which occupy them? How will malls convince shoppers, it’s safe to return? How will they address over – crowding, air circulation, enhanced sanitation, etc? Will the malls of today, becoming, out – dated, and become the equivalent of Ghost Towns ? Mall owners should be considering these, and other significant, relevant issues, in a responsible way, which addresses, both, the true health concerns, etc, as well as the perceived ones! If potential shoppers, don’t feel it’s safe, to return, they won’t!  2. The number, and size of bank branches: Besides the health concerns, will banks discover, based on the experiences, during this pandemic, they do not need, branches, which are, as large, nor, as many branches, as they presently occupy? Because of health concerns, they have been emphasizing remote banking, and using Automated Teller Machines (ATMs), etc, and most bank lobbies, have been closed, except by appointments. Will they believe, they might increase their profits, by transforming, the size and configuration, of how they do business?  3. Other retail: Will smaller strip malls, largely, replace malls, because of these concerns? Will we see many larger retail establishments, either, go out of business, or, make their future stores, smaller, and less crowded? Already, some of the largest establishments, have considered, neighborhood stores, instead of their mega – stores. How will this be balanced, and proceed, forward?  4. Office size/ configurations/ split – shifts/ remote employees: For several reasons, I can envision, many businesses, deciding to down – size, for both, health, and economic reasons! How might they change their configurations, to reduce contact, and reduce health risks? Will more, change to split – shifts, etc? Since, for the past couple of months, those businesses, which have been able to remain open, have switched to a larger dependence on remote employees, and, if they can perfect that model, how might it be implemented, as part of their future policies, and operations?  5. Medical/ dental offices – layout, treatment, etc: What changes might medical and dental offices, make? Which might be mandated, in order to reopen? We will, almost, definitely, see a greater emphasis on Personal Protection Apparel, such as masks, head coverings, over – garments (disposable), etc! What changes/ enhancements/ improvements, will become the wave – of – the – future? How might air purification be enhanced? How will patient scheduling, etc, be affected? Will physicians, and dentists, need to change, schedules, times between patients, etc, so there are fewer, waiting in the Waiting Rooms, etc? With these changes, increased costs, and the ability to see, as many patients, reduced, won’t these professionals, be adversely affected? Will the trend, to larger offices, be replaced, with a return, to smaller ones?  6. Restaurants of the future: What might the restaurants, of the future, look like? How many of these, especially, the independently owned ones, go permanently, out – of – business? For health reasons, how might occupancy levels, be affected/ reduced, and won’t it make, owning these, less desirable, etc? Will the emphasis, switch, to a larger percentage, of take – out, and catering?  7. Education : for MENA region countries, education will change drastically, the middle eastern countries are very familiar with online learning, but having the necessary fundamentals to retain the educational platforms is something and preparing the masses for it, mentally and logistic wise is complexity different.. Arabs countries specially jordan has certain remote demographics that require extra effort and attention, in terms of electricity, internet coverage, and providing the needed devices such as laptops and tablets.  Most of low economical compounds and remote areas residents, cant afford the needed devices to get their kids the needed education, where the governmental school only cost once was walking on their feet, and get in charities lists to support their kids education, now this cost will go higher as they dont have any of they much needed basics for online education …  Finally , coping, and problem solving is human strongest suites that distinguished them from other creatures, but what we really needs to see more from, is the empathy and humanity in the ability of helping those in need and save them pain of asking..  — Published on May 2, 2020   You might also like...

"India to step up battle for 2032 Olympics after pandemic  02 May 2020, 09:45 by AFP  In Summary   Ten years after hosting the Commonwealth Games, the Indian Olympic Association president said his country had lessons to learn but would not be deterred.    NEW DEHLI   India will step up its battle to win the 2032 Olympic Games and other international events when the global coronavirus pandemic eases, its top sports leader Narinder Batra told AFP.  Ten years after hosting the Commonwealth Games, the Indian Olympic Association president said his country had lessons to learn but would not be deterred.  ""We are serious and definitely pitching for the 2026 Youth Olympic Games and the 2032 Olympics,"" he said Friday.  India has already written expressions of interest to the International Olympic Committee but faces reported competition from Thailand, Russia and Colombia for the 2026 event.  Queensland in Australia, Shanghai and a potential joint bid between Seoul and Pyongyang are also being touted for the 2032 Olympics.  However, the pandemic has halted all debate. Batra, also head of the International Hockey Federation, said ""documentation"" has started for 2032 but work is now frozen. A final decision may take until 2025.  ""Now there is a team that visits the various venues and you keep talking to them and then they submit a report. It is a continuous process which I believe will see no activity until December,"" India's most influential sports leader said.  ""This is not the time to talk with business houses or government about pitching for the Olympics. The first thing should be how we sort out this problem which has come into the world,"" Batra added, referring to the virus.  Delhi's hosting of the Commonwealth Games was marked by construction delays, failing infrastructure and accusations of financial mismanagement.  More recently, Delhi was stripped of the 2021 world boxing championships, with the global body accusing organisers of failing to pay a hosting fee on time.  Batra said he knew nothing of the boxing dispute but insisted that the 2010 multi-sport event had made India think big and its growing economic clout means it has resources.  ""I can say the biggest takeaway was that India is capable of hosting all big-ticket events whether it is Olympics or any other Games,"" said Batra.  But he added that New Delhi did not capitalise enough on the 2010 Games by encouraging more young athletes.  ""The Delhi event fell short on legacy values. The legacy that you produce more athletes and you develop them never happened here and that is why tournaments shifted out of Delhi,"" he said.  ""The fact that such a big event happened here was not properly exploited.""  India has a population of 1.3 billion people but while it excels at cricket, its team returned from the 2016 Rio Olympics with just two medals.  The coronavirus pandemic has only made it harder for athletes to train for the postponed Tokyo Olympics, put back until at least 2021.  But Batra is sticking to his prediction that India will get more than 10 medals whenever the next Games are held.  ""About 80 Indian athletes have already qualified for the Olympics and are being monitored by directors and chief coaches,"" he said.  ""So I maintain my earlier prediction of a double-figure medal tally and I don't think this situation will change anything.""  Batra said he was counting on the men's hockey team - which has won eight Olympic golds but not finished in the first four since 1980 - to return to success.  ""In this Olympics I am certainly looking to the men's team for a medal,"" he said."	News

Taiwan's latest coronavirus findings published  COVID-19's most infectious period is early stages, even before symptoms show  02 May 2020, 08:49 by Lyla Liu  Taiwan's latest find out of Coronavirus has been published on US' medical journal (Screenshot photo of CECC) Taiwan's latest find out of Coronavirus has been published on US' medical journal (Screenshot photo of CECC)  TAIPEI (Taiwan News) – Taiwan's latest Wuhan coronavirus findings were published by a prestigious American journal Saturday (May 2), indicating that COVID-19 is most infectious during the early stages of the disease.  Taiwan's Central Epidemic Command Center (CECC) teamed up with National Taiwan University professor Lin Hsien-Ho (林先和) for the report. It was published in the Jama Internal Medicine magazine, established by the American Medical Association, in 1908.  According to a CECC website statement, the report titled, Contact Tracing Assessment of COVID-19 Transmission Dynamics in Taiwan and Risk at Different Exposure Periods Before and After Symptom Onset, was based on the first 100 confirmed cases in Taiwan. The median age of those infected was 44, ranging from 11 to 88 years old, with 56 men and 44 women.  The study showed the most infectious period was in the very early stages of the disease or even before the onset of symptoms. Additionally, the report suggested the pandemic will not be controlled if only symptomatic cases are isolated.  Social distancing is required to contain the epidemic, the study indicated. CECC said the findings will enable the world to have a better understanding of COVID-19 and its transmission, so more effective prevention policies can be implemented.   RELATED ARTICLES	News

American Gods  Double episode new series ★★★★  9.20pm, SBS Viceland  Even those who find the supernatural stuff a bit of a stretch will have to admit those aspects of this post-prison adventure thriller based on Neil Gaiman’s novel enrich the drama. The opening credits alone are a sensory feast, the gothic imagery invoking the underworld into which ex-con Shadow Moon (Ricky Whittle, The 100 ) is shoved by the audacious Mr Wednesday (Ian McShane, Deadwood ). This promises to be a battle both of the flesh and conscience.    The world didn't end in 2012, but Ancient Aliens is still putting together the pieces.   Ancient Aliens  ★★  8.30pm, SBS Viceland  The main problem with the Mayan doomsday prophecies on which this flimsy pseudo-history documentary hangs itself is that it is eight years out of date. Perhaps we should take some comfort in the fact that the world didn’t end in 2012, as these gaily dressed experts in 2009 proposed it might, according to ancient calendars possibly influenced by alien visitors. By that logic, the psychics who predicted said the plague of 2020 would end us all could be wrong, too.

Drivers from Punjab who came to Nanded might have infected pilgrims, says Maharashtra PWD minister Ashok Chavan  Ashok Chavan said a total of 78 buses with two drivers each had reached Nanded on April 26 and the drivers stayed here for two days. “They ate food in ‘langar’ (community kitchen). There is a possibility that the infection spread then,” he added.  02 May 2020, 23:41 by Partha Sarathi Biswas  Congress leader and Maharashtra PWD minister Ashok Chavan on Saturday said that it was possible that drivers, who had ferried pilgrims from a gurdwara in Nanded in Maharashtra to Punjab in buses, might have spread coronavirus infection among them. On Saturday, as many as 20 sewadars of Gurdwara Shri Langar Sahib in Nanded, where stranded pilgrims from Punjab had stayed during the lockdown, also tested positive for coronavirus.  During a Facebook Live session, Chavan said: “The drivers from Punjab, who came to Nanded and took the pilgrims back, might have got infected during their journey. These drivers might have also carried the infection to the gurdwara in Nanded and also among the pilgrims during the return journey.”  An MLA from the district, Chavan is also the Guardian Minister of Nanded, which houses Gurdwara Langar Sahib and Gurdwara Hazur Sahib.  Chavan said a total of 78 buses with two drivers each had reached Nanded on April 26 and the drivers stayed here for two days. “They ate food in ‘langar’ (community kitchen). There is a possibility that the infection spread then,” he added.  About the possibility of the infection originating in Nanded, Chavan said: “None of the pilgrims had complained about COVID-19 like symptoms earlier during their stay at the gurdwara. Had any such complaint been made, treatment would have been provided to them immediately.”  Nanded authorities too claimed that the pilgrims picked up the infection during their travel back to Punjab, which took them through cities such as Indore and Bhilwara, which have reported a large number of COVID-19 cases.  District authorities pointed out that the pilgrims had been screened four times during their stay and they had not shown any signs of infection. They also claimed that the pilgrims had been screened before they boarded the buses. The number of COVID-19 cases in Nanded, which had reported six patients and two deaths till now, rose to 26 on Saturday.  After 20 sewadars of Gurdwara Shri Langar Sahib tested positive Saturday, district authorities sealed off the area near the gurdwara and started the process of tracing high-risk contacts of those infected.  BJP MP from Nanded Pratap Patil Chikhalihar said the rise in the number of cases was a cause of worry for district authorities. “I am coordinating with authorities about the situation and have kept a very close watch on it,” he said.  Samples of the sewadars, those who serve in the shrine, were taken after Nanded pilgrims had started testing positive after reaching back Punjab.  Meanwhile, the SGPC on Saturday asked the Punjab CM to shift Nanded returnees to gurdwara inns instead of housing them at quarantine facilities created inside deras.

"""I'm starving now"": World faces unprecedented hunger crisis  02 May 2020, 23:03 by Debora Patta  It's Friday morning in Alexandra township – a poor neighborhood on the outskirts of South Africa's largest city, Johannesburg – and dozens of people are gathered in a field outside a food distribution point, hoping today might be the day they get something to eat.  ""If you're hungry, it's easy to get sick from stress and everything,"" says Mduduzi Khumalo, who's been lining up every day for two weeks. To get food your name has to be on the list and, so far, despite registering multiple times, his hasn't been.  Khumalo worked as a delivery man before South Africa's coronavirus lockdown decimated his income. His children used to get two meals a day at school, but schools are closed now. Every day, the kids wait for him at the family's tiny home, and every day brings the same bad news.  ""They know that if I don't get anything for them, it's over,"" Khumalo tells CBS News.  Famines ""of biblical proportions""Residents of Diepsloot in South Africa wait for food but go home empty handed of Friday, April 23.  CBS News  The coronavirus pandemic has left the world facing an unprecedented hunger crisis. The United Nations World Food Program (WFP) has warned that by the end of the year, more than 260 million people will face starvation – double last year's figures.  ""In a worst-case scenario, we could be looking at famine in about three dozen countries,"" warned WFP director David Beasley. He said the world could face multiple famines ""of biblical proportions within a few short months.""  Oil prices have collapsed, tourism is drying up, and overseas remittances – foreign workers transferring money to their families in other countries – on which many people depend for survival, are expected to decline sharply.  There's ""a real danger that more people could potentially die from the economic impact of COVID-19 than from the virus itself,"" Beasley said.  Sub-Saharan Africa particularly at risk  If global GDP declines by 5% because of the pandemic, another 147 million people could be plunged into extreme poverty, according to estimates by the Washington-based International Food Policy Research Institute.    patta-pic-2.jpg   Children wait for food aid from their parents near Johannesburg, South Africa, on Friday, April 23. CBS News  More than half of those people – 79 million – live in sub-Saharan Africa, David Laborde Debucquet, a senior research fellow at IFPRI, told the Thomson Reuters Foundation. Another 42 million are in South Asia, he said.  ""We are talking about (people) earning below $1.90 a day... where basically your life is in danger because, when you have this type of poverty and you cannot eat, you will die,"" Debucquet told the Thomson Reuters Foundation. ""This will affect the urban poor much more. In the last couple of decades, we have seen very fast urbanization in these two regions.""  ""I'm afraid of getting sick, and I'm afraid of starving.""  Thandi Lebho, 39, lives in the South African township of Diepsloot. She and her husband and three children have been waiting for food donations for three weeks. They haven't been able to get what they need since South Africa's lockdown began and her income from selling tupperware containers dried up.  ""I've registered online and by phone, and I write on the papers from the street, and I came here at the clinic and registered, but nothing happened,"" she tells CBS News. When she manages to get to the food distribution truck, it's already run out of supplies.  ""The kids are not going to school and education is going low. We are struggling to get money because I'm working for myself. I'm self-employed – so my business is in my house – so I'm not earning anything now,"" she says. ""I'm starving now. I don't have anything.""  She'll be back in the food line tomorrow, trying to get something to keep her family going.  ""I'm afraid of getting sick, and I'm afraid of starving,"" she says.

Future BMW Electric Scooter Rendered With Unique Z Design  02 May 2020, 15:19 by Surendhar M  BMW Motorrad E-Scooter Concept by Carota Design looks futuristic as its design is inspired by the Concept Link  Seeing the Carota Design’s electric scooter concept will make you wonder why hasn’t BMW Motorrad already considered making it because it is that darn good. The German manufacturer recently stopped the C Evolution zero-emission scooter as only the IC-engined C 650 GT and C 400 X are offered.  The BMW Motorrad E-Scooter Concept By Carota Design takes plenty of inspiration from the latest range of C-series scooters. It must be noted that the styling direction is also influenced by the Concept Link introduced three years ago. The major difference has to be the sleeker front end of the Carota K04-55 while retaining the futuristic appeal.  It has a long wheelbase with the rear wheel stretched far behind and it remains exposed while the tail section rises towards the end. Its peculiar Z-shaped design when looked from the sides enables more space for the rider’s legs and perhaps for some everyday luggage too. Beneath the seat, the battery pack and the electric motor are mounted but the under saddle storage could be limited, except for some accessory brackets if provided.     You do get a feel that even mounting a top box or a pannier is difficult with this sleek design. BMW Motorrad unveiled the Concept Link at the Concorso d’Eleganza Villa d’Este 2017 and was said to combine the challenges of urban mobility of tomorrow with the opportunities of a digitalised world.  The company believed that by connecting rider, vehicle and environment allows for a completely new riding experience with the design study with “reduced styling” according to the brand’s Head of Design. The Concept Link did not offer any good storage space either but the C 650 GT and C 400 X are more practical with plenty of space.  Providing ample space is one of the main reasons for people buying these maxi scooters. The Concept Link may not ever make it to production but a more conventional scooter with an electric powertrain inspired by the concept cannot be ruled out in the future.

U.S. journalist Daniel Pearl's parents challenge freeing of his convicted killers  02 May 2020, 15:18 by Asif Shahzad  ISLAMABAD (Reuters) - Slain U.S. journalist Daniel Pearl’s parents have petitioned to the Pakistani Supreme Court seeking to overturn a ruling that freed four men who had been convicted in 2002 of involvement in his killing, their lawyer said on Saturday.  “We’re standing up for justice, not only for our son, but for all our dear friends in Pakistan so they can live in a society free of violence and terrorism,” Pearl’s father Judea said in an emotional video message posted on Twitter.  Their lawyer Faisal Siddiqi told Reuters he had filed the petition on their behalf. A court official said it had yet to be admitted for further proceedings.  “A bare perusal of the entire record would reveal that there was a plethora of incriminating evidence, both forensic as well as oral, which proved that murder was committed and that all the accused persons aided and abetted the murder,” the appeal petition said.  Islamist militant Ahmed Omar Saeed Sheikh, a Briton of Pakistani origin who was sentenced to death in 2002 for masterminding Pearl’s murder, had his sentence commuted last month and three of his aides who had been sentenced to life in prison were acquitted for lack of evidence by a high court in the southern port city of Karachi.  Pakistani authorities however ordered the four to be kept in detention for three months.  The United States denounced the high court ruling, with the top U.S. diplomat for south Asia saying it was “an affront to victims of terrorism everywhere”.  Wall Street Journal reporter Pearl, 38, was kidnapped in January 2002 while investigating Islamist militants in Karachi, capital of the southern Sindh province. He was beheaded some weeks later.

"Marian Keyes turns to make-up and Zoom to get through coronavirus lockdown  The writer, who has sold 30 million books, said her time in quarantine is suiting her introvert personality  02 May 2020, 15:29 by Lynne Kelleher  Best-selling author Marian Keyes has said she is turning to make-up and Zoom meetings to get through the lockdown.  The writer, who has sold 30 million books, said her time in quarantine in her Dublin home is suiting her introvert personality.  But the Limerick novelist told BBC Four this morning that she is mourning the disintegration of her last hair extension this week.  She said: “About a year and a half ago I started getting extensions and I can never do anything by halves, so I went from fairly long hair to hair that was lapping the backs of my calves.  “Funny enough yesterday was the day my last hair extension fell out here in quarantine.    Marian Keyes in one of her lockdown videos posted on Instagram   “I set my teeth and I said, ‘this is not the worst thing that could happen to anyone’ because I have other things to worry about like my grey roots, so I’m keeping it all in perspective.”  The author, who recently published her latest book, Grown-Ups, said she insists on showing her real life to her 209,000 followers on Twitter.  She said: “It’s too much effort to pretend to have the dream life. It’s much more fun to own up. The best way to have fun is to share my imperfections and hope that other people relate.”  Meanwhile, she said she is going to continue to call out sexism against women in the literary world.  “It bothers me so much that women will read books by men and women whereas men tend to read books only by a man.  “In many ways this is not a fault of men because this is how it has always been, that the male view or the male voice is regarded as the default one and anything written or created by women in any way is regarded a slightly aberrant.  “Of course, every time I start banging on about the patriarchy I will annoy some people and lose readers but it’s a risk I feel able to take.  “I have a platform I should use it for good and in my view in trying to persuade people that books written by women are just as worthy and just as enjoyable and just as important as books by men.”  The writer said her introverted personality is quite suited to pandemic times.  ""I love people but I can only take them for about an hour and a half at a time.  ""The lovely thing about social media is you can interact with people and then you can go without having to do the exhausting process that happened in real life.  ""It really suits the need to be able to live like this.""  And she said she has been getting to grips with the etiquette of Zoom meetings.  “You have to be brutal especially Irish people who are known for very, very lengthy goodbye. It is the most exhausting process of meeting anyone in real life or on Zoom, the valedictions.  “Just cut it. Be brutal.”  She said she staged the Lipstick World Cup and the Foundation World Cup as sporting tournaments on her social media platforms during lockdown.  “Our imaginations are working in different ways at the moment and for some reason all my pleasure is in makeup at the moment.    Marian Keyes in one of her lockdown videos posted on Instagram   “We’re definitely looking for frivolous escape, so people voted for (foundations) then I moved on to the Lipstick World Cup.”  The writer also told BBC Four’s Saturday Live programme that she does feel obliged to call out Twitter bullies.  She said: “Having had the great good fortune myself to have gone through a long bout of rickety mental health I really understand what it’s like from the inside out.  “So if somebody shares how they are feeling and they are frightened or they feel they are on their way down I will absolutely jump in if I see a message from them and reassure them or try to advise them if they want my advice.  “If people are mean I will defend them because I think the issue is about visibility and the more people that stands up for vulnerables, the more unacceptable it becomes to bully them.”  She said she says she is aware of the dark side of Twitter.  “It can be savagely cruel at times. For me I have been able to build a community around that is full of lovely people, sound people who care about the right things and who were also there for fun I get so much enjoyment out of Twitter.”  She said she is finding it difficult at the moment to be away from her large Limerick family.  “It is difficult at the moment. I am the eldest of five and everyone in my family has big personalities right down to two-and-a-half-year-old Hannah.  “I am at my happiest when I am in the thick of my rowdy, shouty family.”   Read More"	News
"RBI cancels licence of CKP Co-operative Bank; depositors to get up to Rs 5 lakh  02 May 2020, 15:44 by Chitranjan Kumar   On liquidation, depositors are entitled to repayment of their deposits up to Rs 5 lakh only from the Deposit Insurance and Credit Guarantee Corporation (DICGC) as per usual terms and conditions, RBI said   The Reserve Bank of India on Saturday cancelled the licence of CKP Co-operative Bank, with effect from the close of business on April 30, 2020. On liquidation, depositors are entitled to repayment of their deposits up to Rs 5 lakh only from the Deposit Insurance and Credit Guarantee Corporation (DICGC) as per usual terms and conditions, the RBI said in a press release.  ""The financial position of the bank is highly adverse and unsustainable. There is no concrete revival plan or proposal for merger with another bank. Credible commitment towards revival from the management is not visible,"" the RBI said.  The Registrar of Co-operative Societies, Pune, Maharashtra, has been asked to issue an order for winding up the affairs of the Mumbai-based CKP Co-operative Bank and appoint a liquidator for the bank, it said.  Following the cancellation of its licence, the bank is prohibited accepting deposits and repayment of deposits with immediate effect.

""The bank has not been complying with provisions of Section 22 (3)(b) and (c) of the Act,"" it added.  According to the RBI, the bank's efforts for revival ""have been far from adequate though it has been given ample time and opportunity and dispensations"". ""No merger proposal has been received in respect of the bank. Thus, in all likelihood, public interest would be adversely affected if the bank were allowed to carry on its business any further,"" the RBI said.  Established in 1915, CKP Co-operative Bank is one of the oldest urban co-operative bank in Mumbai. The bank has head office at Matunga and has 8 branches spread across Mumbai and Thane Districts.

Leeds have not featured in the English top-flight since their relegation in 2004 and have missed out on promotion on a number of occasions since.  Marcelo Bielsa's side are currently top of the Championship with 11 matches of the campaign remaining but saw their ambitions halted following the postponement of football back in March.  Leeds remain favourites to return to the Premier League when the season gets back under way, and Grayson believes that players like Sergio Romero could be attracted to Elland Road to play under Bielsa if they do go up.  “If Leeds get back to the Premier League, playing for the club is an exciting prospect for anybody,” he told the Daily Star.  “They’ll be attracting players from all other globe - regardless of whether they’re Argentinian or playing for Manchester United.  “Getting in front of the Elland Road faithful and working for Bielsa is a massive proposition.  “It won’t be an issue attracting players. They’ll be having recruitment meetings - Bielsa, Victor Orta and Angus Kinnear.  “There will be two lists at this moment in time. One for if they make the Premier League and one for the worst-case scenario of staying in the Championship.”	News

Making The Grade: Building a low-cost distance-learning solution during COVID-19  02 May 2020, 13:00 by Bradley Chambers  The past few weeks have been wild at my school . Over just a few days, we went from thinking there would be a 20% chance we’d shut down to making serious plans due to the COVID–19 outbreak. This scenario meant that we had to launch a distance learning platform virtually overnight. This week, for Making The Grade, I want to explain how I built a low-cost, distance learning solution for our school.  About Making The Grade : Every Saturday, Bradley Chambers publishes a new article about Apple in education. He has been managing Apple devices in an education environment since 2009. Through his experience deploying and managing hundreds of Macs and hundreds of iPads, Bradley will highlight ways in which Apple’s products work at scale, stories from the trenches of IT management, and ways Apple could improve its products for students.   When we began to make plans, I knew I wanted two things to be my focus: simplicity for teachers and ease of access for parents.  Simplicity for teachers  Our teachers already had to figure out how to teach remotely, so my goal was to make the publishing process as easy as possible. I originally thought we’d be recording in QuickTime, but then I realized teachers would end up doing a lesson in two parts: full camera and screen recording. I realized that the Zoom app would allow us to record our screen and overlay the camera for free . They would start empty meetings, hit record, run through their lesson, and then save the video. Our students also did live group check-ins using Zoom, so the benefit was that our teachers only had to learn a single application to begin recording digital lessons. Because our teachers’ MacBook Airs have built-in cameras and microphones, no other equipment was needed.  Simplicity for parents  Another critical factor I needed to consider was ease of access for parents. I knew that our parents had likely had their work lives thrown into turmoil, so the last thing I wanted was to create headaches for them. Instead of trying to roll out a new Learning Management Solution overnight that would create challenges, we went with a simple approach: Embed the videos to our website (password protected) by grade and organized by subject. Our first week went great, and we had lots of kind words from parents on how easy it was for parents to access the content.  Turning in assignments  For turning in assignments, we allowed parents to scan the work with their smartphone and email the teachers. If they didn’t want to do or weren’t able to do that, we had “drop off” and “pick up” days at our school where parents could drive through and be handed new assignments while turning in old ones.  Thank you, Zoom  I cannot thank Zoom enough for how it’s supported schools during this time. It’s upgraded our accounts to offer more than 40 minutes of meetings for free, and its app has been excellent for us. Applications like Camtasia would have certainly been more powerful, but for our use case, using Zoom has empowered our teachers to teach students. It truly allowed us to build a low-cost distance-learning solution during COVID-19.  Wrap-up on low-cost distance-learning solution during COVID-19  It’s been a crazy few weeks, and it’s probably just beginning. But I feel like we struck a delicate yet effective balance for the size of our school. Larger districts certainly couldn’t have used a solution like ours, but it worked for us. If you learn anything from this article, it’s to focus on the overall experience for teachers and parents while finding a solution that works well for your environment. The only costs we incurred were upgrading a single Zoom account for some larger meetings as well as moving to Vimeo Business for our video hosting.  Going forward, if we need to build a new solution for a longer period, I would certainly turn to a more permanent solution powered by Clever logins .	NotNews
Boris Johnson and Carrie Symonds name son after doctors who treated prime minister when he had Covid-19  Wilfred Lawrie Nicholas Johnson was born on Wednesday.  02 May 2020, 13:13 by Press Association  BORIS JOHNSON AND Carrie Symonds have named their son Wilfred Lawrie Nicholas Johnson, in a tribute to their grandfathers and the doctors who helped save the UK Prime Minister’s life.  Symonds, 32, posted a picture of her cradling the newborn on Instagram on Saturday, saying she “couldn’t be happier” and that her “heart is full”.  She praised the maternity team at University College Hospital in London, who she said “looked after us so well”.  Symonds and Wilfred are understood to be back in Number 10 with Johnson.  The couple announced on Wednesday that she had given birth to a baby boy earlier that day.  It came just weeks after Johnson was discharged from intensive care where he had been battling coronavirus. Symonds also suffered symptoms of the disease.  She wrote in her Instagram post: “Introducing Wilfred Lawrie Nicholas Johnson born on 29.04.20 at 9am.  “Wilfred after Boris’ grandfather, Lawrie after my grandfather, Nicholas after Dr Nick Price and Dr Nick Hart – the two doctors that saved Boris’ life last month.  “Thank you so, so much to the incredible NHS maternity team at UCLH that looked after us so well. I couldn’t be happier. My heart is full.”     Source: Ali Fortescue /Twitter    Johnson, who is currently grappling with the Covid-19 crisis which has led to the deaths of over 27,000 people in the UK so far, is expected to take a “short period” of paternity leave later in the year.  The new family are planning to live in their Downing Street flat along with their dog Dilyn, Downing Street has said.  In February, the couple announced they were expecting a baby in “early summer” and that they had become engaged at the end of 2019.  They made history as the first unmarried couple to officially live together in Downing Street when they moved in last summer, after Johnson won the Conservative Party leadership contest.  The new arrival is the third baby born to a serving prime minister in recent history.  Tony Blair’s wife Cherie gave birth to son Leo in May 2000, three years after her husband’s first election victory.  David Cameron and wife Samantha welcomed daughter Florence in 2010.  The last babies born to prime ministers before Leo and Florence arrived more than 150 years ago.  Wilfred is Symonds’s first child, while Johnson is known to have fathered at least five others.  #Open journalism No news is bad news Support The Journal  Your contributions will help us continue to deliver the stories that are important to you   Support us now	News
"Wine businesses and smaller restaurants are getting creative to stay afloat, according to a master sommelier — but even as alcohol purchases boom the industry needs our support  02 May 2020, 14:00 by Jonathan Ross   Jonathan Ross is one of the 300 master sommeliers in the world: He is an educator for the Guild of Sommeliers, an examiner for the Court of Master Sommeliers, and sits on multiple wine investment advisory boards, as well as founded Micro Wines .  He says that although the alcohol industry is booming for large retailers, small businesses are struggling to find ways to stay afloat.  Many smaller retailers and restaurants are turning to creative ways of staying open, including virtual tastings, delivery, and designer happy hours.  Support your local restaurants and wine sellers now if you want them to survive this lockdown period.   Click here for more BI Prime stories.    With a substantial amount of lockdown time under our belts, people around the world have found creative ways to remain social, active, and entertained. Virtual cocktail hours and dinner parties, live educational tastings, and all-around beverage discourse are filling social media airwaves.    Jonathan Ross. Jonathan Ross   There is no way to replace genuine human interactions: a necessity for a healthy life. However, this crisis has reminded many of us that at the center of human contact often lies a great drink.  And continuing to drink well, learn well, and do well by the wine industry in this time is not only possible, but imperative.  Over the past decade, wine has seen a growth in consumer demand for information and validation. With the rise in popularity of the sommelier profession, access to expert advice has grown, such as on SommTV . Winemakers, retail buyers, trained sommeliers, wine journalists, and enthusiast influencers have all become more prominent, widening a previously narrow field of critics whose scores focused on retail shelves and an endless sea of Yelp-like reviews on wine apps like Vivino .  Consumers seek greater interactivity and down-to-earth advice (try Crunchy Red Fruit or SommSelect ). Restaurants remain the treasure trove, attracting enthusiasts of all levels looking to quench their thirst for wine experiences at restaurants.  Enter COVID-19. Since the novel coronavirus took hold, alcohol sales in the US have actually boomed . So much so that the first 30 days of quarantine resembled the alcohol-fuelled holiday mania of December.  But almost all that business is being funnelled through established retail supply chains; a small percentage of restaurants and bars are attempting to create in-home experiences to stay afloat. This all goes beyond the sudden deluge of social media hashtags like # quarantinecocktail — this is about supporting an industry that is at risk of faltering.  How some small wine businesses are getting by  For restaurants without an already-established retail arm, creativity and agility have been the only ways to survive. Robust social media marketing supported by rich online content is the key for these businesses to tap into the current retail boom.  Master Sommelier Laura Fiorvanti — one of 35 women in the world with this prestigious title — leads Corkbuzz group. Based in New York and North Carolina, she is taking their offerings online. With streamed versions of her in-house tastings matched with wine packs that can be purchased and shipped from the Corkbuzz cellar, she's turning what was once thought of as an in-person-only event into something that's not only more affordable, but also can be done in your own home.  National retailer and Vermont wine bar Dedalus has also curated a wide variety of online entertainment that traverses everything from one-on-one happy hours with notable sommeliers to foundational lessons on cheese and its best pairings to fun-loving wine and DJ sets.  The New York branch of La Compagnie de Vins Surnaturels , with managing partner Caleb Ganzer, has taken to YouTube with their in-house "" Wine Boot Camp ,"" popular with the millennial drinker given that they have over 1,000 people log on at a time, and are able to deliver featured wines to the local area thanks to temporary retail licenses being made available to restaurants. (States have banned the on-premise sale and consumption of food and alcohol, they authorized take-away and delivery retail sales for all current liquor license holders.)  For other restaurants looking for ways to thrive through the pandemic, focusing on the in-home experience is key. Whether it's a ready-to cook dinner paired with beverages, individually bottled cocktails, or working with sommeliers and winemakers to create video wine tastings, there needs to be an effort to engage with people in their homes.  But virtual content alone can't sustain the industry  Though it may be too soon to tell what combination of virtual content will allow some to surge forward, what is clear is the need to help preserve the restaurant world. Stark numbers overshadow the hope that some restaurants have. According to the Independent Restaurant Coalition and the James Beard Foundation , over 500,000 restaurants have closed temporarily, causing the loss of over 11 million jobs. Only 20% of those closed restaurants believe they'll be able to afford to come back once the new normal sets in.  While a few economic thinkers believe this will just result in a great re-shuffling, others fear that it will expedite the homogenization of American restaurants: a patchwork of individual small businesses that represents the largest private industry employer in the US.  Large, online-only retailers have seen the largest spike in their revenue during the novel coronavirus era, jumping three-figure percentage points in just days. They represent big discounts on large-production wines and a low-risk comfort zone — purchasing that arrives at your door with zero human interaction. It's these inherent pillars that big businesses are built on, and it's working.  If you're at home, shop local  If there was ever a moment to support small business, now is the time.  All restaurants were deemed as essential businesses. If they haven't shuttered, takeout food and beverage is the only way they are surviving. If someone wants to buy a bottle of wine, check out what is available at a local restaurant first, then a local wine shop.  Some restaurants have turned into grocers that support local farms and butchers. Anything bought here will be fresher and of better quality than what would be found at a supermarket. Lastly, if looking to donate, Frontline Foods and the Independent Restaurant Coalition are the most secure and effective avenues.  If you can think of a restaurant or small retail shop where you thoroughly enjoyed their hospitality, then seek out that place and patronize them. Chances are, they're scrambling to pack wine and food to-go orders so they can one day reopen their doors and welcome you home.

"Man arrested trying to quarantine on private Disney island   02 May 2020, 14:22   ORLANDO, Fla. — Florida deputies arrested a man who had been living out his quarantine on a shuttered Disney World island, telling authorities it felt like a ""tropical paradise.""  Orange County Sheriff's deputies found Richard McGuire on Disney's Discovery Island on Thursday. He said he'd been there since Monday or Tuesday and had planned to camp there for a week, according to an arrest report.  The 42-year-old said he didn't hear numerous deputies searching the private island for him on foot, by boat and by air because he was asleep in a building. He told the deputy he didn't know it was a restricted area, despite there being numerous ""no trespassing"" signs.  ""Richard stated that he was unaware of that and that it looked like a tropical paradise,"" according to the arrest report.  Orange County Marine deputies on Bay Lake used a public address system to tell McGuire he was not allowed to be on the property, but he remained on the island, anyway, according to the arrest report.  A security representative for Disney said she saw McGuire using a company boat Thursday, noting that the area had several ""no trespassing"" signs and two closed gates. She asked the agency to press charges.  McGuire was arrested on a trespassing charge and taken to jail without incident. It was not immediately clear whether he had an attorney who could comment.  Previously called Treasure Island, Discovery Island had been the site of a zoological park before the island was closed to the public in 1999."	News

"Mazda's Greatest Road Cars  You bet the Miata is on this list.  02 May 2020, 22:35 by Ian Wright  Of all the automakers with a deep history and back catalog, Mazda has remained the most consistent in its focus on design and technology. Where many car companies have had periods of producing bad cars, chasing fads and fashions, Mazda has had just a few rough patches. The biggest rough patch coming at the beginning.  Going back to the beginning, Jujiro Matsuda started Toyo Cork Kogyo Co. in 1920 as a Hiroshima-based cork making company. Financial struggles came, then the company became Toyo Kogyo and made machine tools. In 1931, Toyo Kogyo started producing automobiles, the first of which was the Mazda-Go Autorickshaw. Then came the war, forcing Mazda to shut down through the 1950s, before it started developing the Wankel rotary engine in the 1960s to differentiate itself from its other Japanese competitors. But that's not quite where we'll start this list.     CarBuzz  1960 Mazda R360 Coupe  Mazda's first passenger car was the R360 Coupe more commonly referred to as ""Mazda's Coupe."" With the benefit of hindsight, the microcar was a statement of intent when it came out of Mazda's factory as the product of state of the art technology, including early computer-aided design. Light alloy was used for construction to keep the weight down and a four-cylinder 356 cc V-twin engine powered it. A four-cylinder engine was considered a luxury at the time, but Mazda was able to make it affordable and, within a few years, was dominating the Kei-car market in Japan.                 1967 Mazda Cosmo Sport 110S  Talk about Mazda's best cars, and the Wankel rotary engine will inevitably come up in the conversation. The Mazda Cosmo Sport 110S was the first. The beauty of the rotary engine is that it uses fewer parts to build than a regularly configured engine, and is therefore lighter. There are no pistons, as, instead, the engine is a hollow barrel with rounded triangular rotors spinning inside. Kenichi Yamamoto and his team spent years developing Mazda's first rotary engine using German engineer Felix Wankel's design. The 1.0-liter two-rotor engine made just 110 horsepower and 97 lb-ft of torque, but the Cosmo Sport weighed only 2,050 lbs.                1970 Mazda RX-2  The story of the RX name started in 1971 with the RX-2 aka the Mazda Capella in Japan. One of the benefits of the rotary engine is that it can make as much power from less displacement as a larger conventional piston engine. In Japan, engines with a displacement of over 1.5 liters had a higher tax rate, so choosing the 1.1-liter rotary engine option saved Japanese buyers money. In the US, it was available as a sedan or coupe, but the tuning was ""softened"" for the American market. The RX-2 became a stylish alternative to other sedans and coupes and was celebrated for its creative rotary engine and excellent interior design.  Unfortunately, a downside to the rotary engine is fuel economy, and the mid-1970s saw the triple whammy of heightened emission regulations, safety regulations, and the oil crisis. In 1978, the RX-2 was replaced by the Mazda 626 powered by more traditional four-cylinder engines. However, it provided a stepping stone to a cult favorite.             1978 Mazda RX-7  The first-generation RX-7 was not the best RX-7, but it put Mazda on the map as a company that could deliver an incredibly well-balanced two-seater sports car. It was conceived by Yamamoto and put together by most of the team responsible for the Cosmo Sport as well as designer Matasaburo Maeda. The team achieved a perfect 50:50 front/rear balance ratio with a low center of gravity, creating the precise handling Mazda has become known for. Another key to the new RX-7's handling was the small twin-rotary engine being mounted just behind the front axle and providing rear-wheel-drive through a manual transmission.          1989 Mazda MX-5 Miata  Mazda took the idea of the 1960's British roadster, then revived and refined it with modern technology to create a timeless icon. The pursuit of Mazda's Jinba Ittai (rider and horse as one) in automotive terms created an almost perfect driver's car for the mass-market. Not only did it bring all of the joy associated with classic British roadsters, but added modern Japanese reliability. On release, the Miata came with a manual transmission controlling power from a 1.6-liter 4-cylinder engine that delivered just 116 hp and 100 lb-ft of torque. That was then upgraded in 1994, however, anyone judging the Miata based on specs is missing the point.          1991 Mazda RX-7  The second-generation RX-7 was a more serious effort from Mazda and aimed to compete with the Porsche 924/944 as a GT car. It was fast, with turbocharged engine options, and built on the philosophy of the original. However, when Mazda took its third swing at the RX-7, the automaker changed its game again. All thoughts of a GT style car were dropped to produce an uncompromising sports car that blended power with grip and balance. Everything was upgraded and wrapped in a timeless aesthetic design that still doesn't look out of place on the road. Under the hood was a twin-rotor engine bolstered by two turbochargers to produce 255 hp and a wealth of low-end torque. Its balance and precision in handling, its unique and reliable delivery of power, lack of weight, and timeless looks make low-mileage examples some of the most sought after Mazda models today.             2004 Mazdaspeed Miata  The second-generation Miata doubled down on the philosophy of the original and refined the small roadster concept even more. In 2004, though, Mazda's in-house performance division Mazdaspeed bolted a turbo onto the 1.8-liter four-cylinder engine to force 7.25 lbs of air into the combustion chambers. The upgraded engine was matched to the optional six-speed transmission and delivered an extra 36 hp, bringing the total to 178. It didn't turn the Miata into a traffic light racer but transformed the little roadster to the point people started, and still do, wonder why turbocharged options aren't consistently an option. The Mazdaspeed Miata is rare, but not highly coveted because second-generation Miatas are as plentiful as aftermarket turbo kits ready to bolt on in the garage. However, as a factory option, it's one of Mazda's finest.             2010 Mazdaspeed3  The Mazda 3 has consistently been one of the best hatchbacks you can spend hard-earned cash on. Mazdaspeed took the eager little car with a turbocharged 2.3-liter engine and turned it into a hot hatch. The second and final generation refined the recipe with Mazdaspeed's engineers adding a 6-speed manual transmission with wider ratios. The carryover 2.3-liter DISI Turbo engine's ECU was also tweaked to give the 263 hp and 280 lb-ft of torque a more aggressive power curve. The drivetrain then took advantage of a torque-sensing conical limited-slip differential, and the chassis received extra bracing, thicker stabilizers, and larger diameter brakes. The second generation also gained a functional hood scoop to help with cooling. Unfortunately, the Mazdaspeed3 disappeared in 2013 and it doesn't look like it'll return anytime soon.                2003 Mazda RX-8  The RX-8 is one of Mazda's most underrated cars. The reason it didn't live up to the expectations of the RX-7 is that it was a completely different car that also happened to have a rotary engine. It had an extra door for rear passengers, which should have been the first clue for diehard RX fans. As a driver's car, the chassis is beautifully balanced and responsive, the engine isn't powerful but has fantastic throttle response, and it looks good. The 238-hp rotary engine is a gas and oil guzzler, but that's the cost of driving such a unique and responsive engine. Despite that and a reputation as being underpowered, the RX-8 sold well and managed to stay in production from 2003 until 2012. Ultimately, it was emissions standards in Europe that ended the RX-8's run as without those sales, Mazda couldn't justify its continuation.                2017 Mazda CX-5  The midsize crossover segment is one of the hottest fought battles in the industry. Mazda entered the fray in 2013 with the CX-5 and showed off its then-new Kodo design language. Also on the menu was Mazda's new Skyactiv Technology suite. The Skyactiv Technology suite includes a rigid and lightweight platform and a series of fuel-efficient engines and transmissions. Then, in 2017, Mazda overhauled the CX-5 and dropped a thing of beauty that also showed you didn't have to spend a fortune for a lively, fun-to-drive crossover. On top of that, Mazda showed us just what it could do with an interior, and that premium doesn't have to mean expensive.                 Related Reviews"	NotNews
"Biden says 'more than one black woman' in running for vice presidential spot  02 May 2020, 22:59 by Naomi Lim  More than one black woman will be vetted to become Joe Biden's running mate, according to the presumptive 2020 Democratic presidential nominee.  Biden acknowledged in a pretaped interview with MSNBC Saturday the push for him to pick a black woman as his vice president after vowing to include a woman on the ticket during the last primary debate, which was in March.  ""I really do understand that, Al, for real. And that's why I can assure you that of the more than a dozen women that they're taking an initial look at, there are significantly more than one black woman is going to be considered by this group,"" the two-term vice president and Delaware's 36-year senator told network host Al Sharpton.  Potential candidates, including failed 2018 Democratic Georgia gubernatorial nominee Stacey Abrams, have publicly said choosing a black woman as his No. 2 would be politically savvy , given the importance of the demographic to forming a winning coalition in November's general election against President Trump. Other contenders, such as Atlanta Mayor Keisha Lance Bottoms, have skirted around the issue when asked.  Biden's MSNBC appearance is his second on the outlet in as many days, having used a spot during Friday's Morning Joe episode to address allegations of sexual assault and harassment leveled at him by Tara Reade, who was a Senate aide to him in 1993.  On Saturday, Biden reiterated his denials regarding Reade's accusations , saying, ""Unequivocally, it never happened."" Reade, 56, alleges Biden forcibly kissed her and penetrated her with his fingers, as well as inappropriately touched her hair and neck.  The Democratic Party's next standard-bearer also declined to respond to the Trump campaign's assertion that Democrats were applying a different standard to Biden and Reade than they did to Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh and his accusers during Kavanaugh's confirmation process in 2018.  ""Women have a right to be heard, and the press should rigorously investigate the claims like these, and I’d always uphold those principles. But in the end, in every case, the truth is what matters, and in this case, the truth is these claims are false,"" he said.  Reade says she lodged a contemporaneous complaint with the Senate about Biden allegedly sexually harassing her, but not recording the assault. She doesn't remember the name of the office to which she filed the paperwork, but knows she didn't receive a copy of it. Biden on Friday asked the secretary of the Senate to search for the document and to make it public if her team can find it, noting none of his other staffers at the time were told about Reade's issues with him."

The Ministry of Islamic Affairs appealed to all to necessarily seek precision when spreading or circulating news. They should make sure that they take the information from official sources during this period that necessitates concerted efforts by all and their commitment to surpass this crisis.   related articles	News

"Ruto Allies Target Nana Gecaga After Losing Party Seats  03 May 2020, 04:35 by Derrick Okubasu   Jubilee politicians allied to Deputy President William Ruto have reportedly turned their gaze on President Uhuru Kenyatta's family with the latest being his cousin Nana Gecaga.   According to a report by Daily Nation , the leaders, five of whom lost prime seats in the party on Saturday, May 2, unearthed what they termed as worrying practices in the party.  They argued that a company associated with Gecaga was allegedly awarded a tender to supply campaign materials to the party, a move they argued was a conflict of interest.  The company, Bora Ubora Limited, was reportedly paid Ksh361 million by the ruling party after supplying branded T-shirts as well as caps and other materials.     The KICC Managing Director Nana Gecaga goes about her daily activities in her office. File  Gecaga, who also serves as the chief executive officer of Kenyatta International Conference Center (KICC), reportedly made the supply with her brother Jomo Gecaga and the president's cousin Selina Renee Pratt.  Shortly after, there is said to have been a back and forth on payment as part of the delivery proof was reportedly missing yet the team demanded payment.  DP Ruto's allies also alleged that the party was among those that failed to file their returns despite the fact that they received money from the government.  The party's Secretary-General Raphael Tuju, however, refuted the claim disclosing that the party ""receive funds from the government and therefore have to follow the law."" He further added that the party also advertised for the supplies.  A spot-check of the company, Bora Ubora, by Kenyans.co.ke , shows that the company is an obscure entity without much of description over which industry it operates in or what goods it deals with.  The only notable information about the company is a mention by Gecaga on LinkedIn that she owns the firm whose location is pegged in London, United Kingdom.  In the changes published by Tuju, new appointees Lucy Nyawira Macharia, Marete Marungu, Walter Nyambati, Jane Nampaso, and James Waweru replaced outgoing leaders Fatuma Shukri, Pamela Mutu, and Veronica Maina at the party's apex.  Nana has previously come under fire in her role as KICC CEO with the latest being millions in debt that the parastatal she heads owed suppliers.  KICC owed some 69 small and medium enterprises (SMEs) accrued payments to the tune of Ksh211 million which a huge chunk of the debt dating back to 2015.  In her response, at the time, Gecaga admitted that the parastatal could not settle the debt as it was also facing cash crunch over limited allocation from the state.  “If the government does not give us money... The government owes KICC a lot of money,” she justified the parastatal's failure to settle the debt.

"AFL biased toward Victorian clubs, says Rockliff   03 May 2020, 04:35   Port Adelaide midfielder Tom Rockliff says the AFL is biased toward Victorian teams after the league's ruling to prevent certain clubs resuming group training.  The Western Australian government has lifted the local limit on outdoor gatherings to 10 people with the state's COVID-19 cases declining.    Tom Rockliff says the AFL has a bias towards Victorian clubs. AAP   The ruling in WA matches that of South Australia and would have allowed teams in those states to expand their training groups as the AFL moves towards restarting the postponed season.  Gold Coast chief executive Mark Evans has confirmed the two Queensland clubs - the Suns and Brisbane Lions - could also ramp up training if given approval by the AFL after the state government on Friday eased restrictions.  But the AFL quickly stepped in to ensure the 10 Victorian clubs, along with Sydney and GWS, were not disadvantaged by different restrictions in different states, stressing all 18 teams must abide by initial rules where players can only train with one other person.     While Rockliff – who captained Brisbane and has spent his entire 191-game career outside of Victoria – could understand the AFL's predicament, he was still frustrated by the stance.  ""I sort of get where the AFL's coming from. They wanted to go with Scott Morrison's advice and the federal government,"" Rockliff told ABC Radio.  ""The ability for us to train in groups would have been handy but as we know the AFL makes the rules and it's generally got a bias towards Victorian teams, and that's just the way it goes.  ""It's something we have to adjust to but I sort of understand it in this scenario.""  Greater Western Sydney's Phil Davis could see both sides of the argument, but was not in favour of restricting training for players of teams based in states that are easing lockdown rules.  ""I see both sides of it, in the sense that, to an extent there is a competitive advantage to being able to train in [groups of] 10,"" he told ABC Grandstand.    GWS' Phil Davis says players who have the freedom to train in larger groups should not be restricted just because other players don't have that same freedom. Edwina Pickles   ""You know, training in twos at the moment is extremely difficult, [we're] working quite hard to stay fit. It makes footy drills a bit harder, motivation can be a bit harder as well, not being [together] in that sense.  ""I'm also of the belief that if they're allowed to, let them go, because if that's the difference between me winning and losing a game in a month or so's time, or two months' time, I'd be pretty disappointed, as an elite athlete.  ""And I'm also a bit of the view that if someone else has a freedom, you shouldn't take it away from them just because someone else doesn't have it.  ""I see the argument from both sides. I see that there is an advantage, but I also see that, if that's the difference between me winning or losing, I'd be pretty disappointed in myself.""  Port Adelaide football boss Chris Davies disagreed with his midfielder, saying the AFL's equalisation move is fair in the current climate of uncertainty.  ""We have the potential to be able to train with more than two people, but we're also going into a period now where there's 15 to 17 of our guys who are going to have to quarantine for two weeks,"" he told ABC Radio.     ""It's really important from here that everyone gets an opportunity to have some form of level playing field.""  West Coast chief executive Trevor Nisbett is expecting the AFL to soon revisit the rules surrounding group training.  ""At the moment, we can have our players around in groups of 10, by law, but protocols from the AFL are you can only do it in pairs,"" he said.  ""That will change very rapidly and hopefully we'll be able to at least start training with groups of 10 and then a few weeks down the track we may be able to get a full group of guys training together.""

Amid Covid-19 pandemic Sanjay Dutt feels there are far bigger worries than just work  03 May 2020, 05:22 by TIMESOFINDIA.COM  Just when the nation was thinking about getting some break from the lockdown, the same got extended. This has further extended the halt on entertainment as well. Reportedly talking on the same subject Bollywood actor Sanjay Dutt said that considering the current situation, there are far bigger worries than just work.  Sanjay Dutt’s movies are also facing the same fate as others amid the Covid-19 outbreak yet the actor feels that the lockdown is for everyone’s safety. According to him the well-being and safety of the audiences is the primary focus as of now, and thereafter comes entertainment. Though there’s no denying the fact that all this is delaying projects, that is reasonable for the nation’s best interest.  The actor has kept his hopes high and is filled with a positive attitude even today. He reportedly said that he will be bringing some exciting projects and interesting characters for his audience.  Meanwhile, Sanjay Dutt through Nargis Dutt Foundation , which was established by his late father, actor Sunil Dutt , is trying to offer as much help as possible.  Sharing a post about the same, he wrote - “While everyone has been trying to help as many people as possible, let’s all do our bit and make sure that no one sleeps hungry. A small contribution of Rs 600 can feed a family of four for two weeks. Now is the time when we need to be there for each other!”	NotNews
Singapore minister says RCEP trade deal on track for year-end signing  03 May 2020, 05:03 by Reuters  SINGAPORE — The Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership (RCEP) trade deal is still on track to be signed by the end of 2020, Singapore’s Minister of Trade and Industry Chan Chun Sing said on Sunday.  RCEP brings together the 10-member Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN), China, Japan, South Korea, Australia and New Zealand. The countries have made an offer to India, which pulled out of talks last November, to see if it is prepared to rejoin discussions.  “If India is unable to rejoin the discussions in the coming month, then plans will continue to proceed with the legal scrubbing for the preparation for the siging at the end of the year,” Chan told reporters.  “At this point in time we are still on track for the signing by the RCEP countries at the end of the year,” he added.  Chan was speaking to reporters on Sunday to outline plans to restart Singapore’e economic activity after curbs put in place to stop the spread of the coronavirus.  Separately he said troubles at Hin Leong Trading Pte Ltd, one of Asia’s top oil traders, were not a reflection of the wider situation in the Singapore oil trading market. However, he said the wider oil trading market will be hurt by global oversupply issues. (Reporting by Aradhana Aravindan in Singapore; Editing by Michael Perry)	News
Trust God through the storm – Plummer  03 May 2020, 05:09 by Shanna Monteith - Sunday Gleaner Writer  In unprecedented times brought on by the COVID-19 pandemic, a season that has caught many off guard, Christian author and singer Angelisa Plummer is encouraging people to trust in God.  In one of her most recent devotionals hosted on the Anointed Writer’s website, Plummer acknowledged that everyone has their individual challenges, but the key to all is faith in the all-knowing Creator.  “We’re all struggling with something in this season. No one can deny that! For some of us, the wait seems longer. The business plan is taking a little more time than it should to materialise. The bank account is empty. The frustration is growing. You feel alone. Your prayers have yet to be answered. You don’t know where the next meal will come from … we’re all struggling in some way, shape or form. But good news! Nothing catches God by surprise. He has a plan and He will see it through,” she said.  God’s Unchanging Ways  Reassuring others of God’s unchanging ways, Plummer continued, “Can you recall a time when you were faced with a similar predicament? Can you recall how that situation worked out? Did God leave you hanging or did He come through for you? Do you remember His faithfulness to you? If so, the same God that came through for you then is the same God who will come through for you today. The scripture tells us that He’s an unchangeable God; He’s the same yesterday, today and forever. God wants us to trust in Him. Hebrews 10:23 tells us to rely on Him for He who promised it is faithful. Throughout the Bible, God proves His faithfulness to His people by leading them safely through or delivering them from all their predicaments and troubles. He will never leave nor forsake His people; His plans are to prosper, not to harm them (Jeremiah 29:11).  The 26-year-old writer of a devotional called Growing in Grace noted that it is important to trust God in these times lest you miss out on what He is doing in this new season.  According to her, “God wants us to trust Him even when we don’t see the end. I know it is easier said than done for some of us, but I find that not trusting Him proves to be much harder. You worry and stress, which can lead to physical illness. I know this because I was a professional worrier, and the end result of me worrying all the time was nothing pretty. I used to get headaches all the time and I struggled a lot mentally. I am still learning how to trust God as the days go by, but I am not where I used to be. Thank God!”  Trusting God is the greatest stress reliever in the world, and our minds play an important role in the process. We have a choice. We can “rely on our own insight and understanding”– endlessly thinking about our problems, trying to figure everything out ourselves, or we can choose to adopt a trusting attitude that says, “God, I don’t know what to do about this situation, and I can’t fix it on my own. Please help me to trust that you know what to do.”    familyandreligion@gleanerjm.com	NotNews
Press freedom declining in Pakistan  03 May 2020, 05:57 by Hammad Sarfraz  KARACHI: Press freedom in Pakistan appears to be on the wane due to attacks and intimidation by various actors, a media rights watchdog said in an annual report.  The report, launched by the Freedom Network, titled ‘Murders, harassment and assault: The tough wages of journalism in Pakistan’, documents 91 assaults and other violations against journalists during the past 12 months. The long list of violations includes the killing of seven journalists, two abduction cases, nine detention cases, eight instances of frivolous lawsuits, 10 cases of censorship, 10 physical assaults, half of which caused severe bodily injuries, and more than 20 cases of written or verbal threats.  Data collected by the media rights watchdog shows that no place in the country, including the federal capital, is safe for media practitioners. Islamabad, the report said is the most dangerous place to practice journalism in Pakistan, with 31 out of the total 91 cases recorded in the federal capital. On the list of most dangerous places within the country, Sindh took the second spot with a total of 24 cases of violations against journalists, followed closely by Punjab with 20 cases, Khyber Pakhtunkhwa with 13, and Balochistan with three cases.  According to the report, the state and its functionaries emerged as the principal threat wielding the biggest stick to browbeat the media into submission. In a whopping 42% of the documented cases of violations against media workers, the victims or their families suspect the involvement of the state and its authorities.  “These actions have defaced the country’s image abroad and has weakened the public’s trust in democracy at home,” said Executive Director, Freedom Network Iqbal Khattak. “Democracy cannot survive without pluralism and diversity. These actions by the current government violate the fundamental principles of democracy,” Khattak added.    PHOTO: Mohsin Alam   In its report, the Freedom Network lists written threats of murder as the top violation against journalists, followed by verbal threats, offline and online harassment, and cases of assassination attempts of which seven resulted in killings.  In the long-run, these threats, force journalists to adopt to self-censorship.  “Enforced and self-censorship is increasing and taking deep-roots in Pakistani journalism, which is very dangerous,” cautioned Khattak. “For a stronger Pakistan, we need a stronger media,” said the media watchdog’s executive director.  The government has actively denied any involvement with censoring the press. Speaking at the Washington-based United States Institute of Peace in July last year, Prime Minister Imran Khan, who has been criticised for ramping up censorship, denied accusations of curbing press freedom.  “The media in Pakistan is not just free, but sometimes out of control,” the prime minister said, hinting that the country needed internal media regulation.  Journalists speaking on the condition of anonymity claimed that the relationship between the state and media has never been perfect, but media freedom, particularly, under Imran Khan, appears to be at its lowest, and censorship is felt stronger than ever before.   Independent assessment   Steven Butler, the Asia program director for the Committee to Protect Journalists, who was forced to leave the country last year said: “There is no doubt that press freedom is under assault in Pakistan.”  “Journalists cannot work freely and do their job of supporting Pakistani democracy when they are under constant attack,” cautioned Butler, who heads the Asia program at the New York-based journalist watchdog group.  Repeated attempts to control the free flow of information, Butler said, amounts to an assault on the constitutionally guaranteed right of the people to access information.  “Citizens need unfettered access to information that only a free press can provide. Actions of the state are impeding that access,” he said.  Pakistan, according to international assessments, is considered a dangerous place for journalists. Intimidation, harassment, and assaults are commonly reported by media workers.  Butler praised the journalists for their talents and bravery. “They carry on under extremely difficult circumstances, so I cannot be pessimistic about the future of press freedom in Pakistan.”  According to Zohra Yusuf, former chairperson of the Human Rights Commission of Pakistan, the country has slipped by three places on a global press freedom index to be ranked 145 out of 180 countries in the annual Reporters Without Borders analysis.  “Throughout the past two years and even in 2020 international organisations, working for press freedom, have expressed concern over the deteriorating state of media freedom in Pakistan,” said Yusuf.  “From politically motivated cases against journalists to economic strangleholds, several strategies are being used to threaten freedom of the press,” she added.  Saroop Ijaz, country representative Human Rights Watch (HRW), a New York-based advocacy group that closely monitors human rights violations all over the world, blamed the government for stifling free expression and journalism.  “There is still outright intimidation and harassment but there are also more sophisticated modes of censoring voices,” said Ijaz.  Dissenting journalists, he said, are forced to go off-air. Besides that, he said: “There is a concerted effort to impeach the credibility of all journalism similar to what we see from other populist, authoritarian governments in the region and around the world,” said the HRW representative.  The state, as mentioned in the annual report by the Freedom Network, Ijaz said, has displayed active hostility toward the existence of an independent, vibrant media.  He blamed the government for being ‘incredibly shortsighted. “It will soon regret the assault on the media,” he warned.  “Pakistan needs a vibrant and independent media to truly become a modern, progressive, democracy,” the HRW representative said.

Hurricane season preparation includes some coronavirus considerations this year   03 May 2020, 18:31   RALEIGH, N.C. (WECT) - While North Carolinians work through the current stay-at-home order due to the coronavirus pandemic, citizens living along the coast know that warmer weather means it is time to prepare for the potential for hurricanes.  North Carolina Governor Roy Cooper has declared this week as Hurricane Preparedness Week across the state. The typical hurricane season runs from June 1 to November 30, although tropical systems can occur outside those parameters as well.  The governor’s advice is to use this week to talk about emergency plans with family members, update any emergency supplies and make sure your insurance is up to date. With the threat of coronavirus still out there, the governor also said evacuation plans should include an idea to stay at a hotel or inland with friends and family as emergency shelters may not be able to maintain much social distancing.  Hurricane preparedness kits should also include hand sanitizer and face masks along with the traditional items this year as well.  Inland flooding and storm surge are always part of the potential storm damage from systems, so this year the state is debuting a new tool called “Know Your Zone,” which is a tiered evacuation system that will show the most vulnerable areas to storm surge and other hazards. You can access that information at this link to see where your address falls.  Recommended items for a hurricane preparation kit include:   Food/water for every member of your family for several days  Copies of insurance cards/papers and identification sealed in a watertight plastic bag  First-aid kit  Weather radio and batteries  Prescription medicines  Sleeping bag or blankets  Changes of clothes  Hygiene items such as toothbrush, toothpaste, soap and deodorant  Cash  Pet supplies including food, water, leashes, bedding, muzzle and vaccination records  Hand sanitizer  Face masks   Stay up to speed with your planning by visiting the First Alert Hurricane Center , which is WECT’s one-stop hurricane preparedness location.

PS5或将使用RDNA 3 游戏帧数会有大幅提升  03 May 2020, 18:39 by ugmbbc       近日，PlayStation内部人士@Tidux 在推上爆料了一条劲爆消息，PS5不仅拥有完整的RDNA 2架构的全部特性，而且还支持部分RDNA 3架构的新技术。首先，@Tidux 表示PS5支持RDNA 2架构的全部特性，包括VRS（可变速率着色）技术，VRS关系到GPU在渲染一帧画面的特定区域时所花费的努力，是一种优化算力的技术，目标是提升性能表现。      最终呈现的游戏画面上，图像品质的牺牲是微乎其微的，但换来的帧数提升会很明显。  当然了，即便拥有RDNA 3技术加持，在硬件上，PS5较 Xbox Series X还是稍逊一筹，单说GPU方面，XSX为RDNA 2架构GPU，主频1.825GHz，52个CU，算力12TFLOPs；PS5同样为RDNA 2架构，主频更高2.23GHz，不过仅有36个CU，算力为10.28TFLOPs。  硬件上的差距也让PS5在次世代主机的竞争中处于下风，就看索尼有没有什么像RDNA 3一样 的特有优化或者特色功能了。	NotNews

Please go ahead, sir.   John Albright   Thank you, operator. Good morning and welcome to today's conference call to review the operating results of Consolidated-Tomoka Land Company for the first quarter ended March 31. My name is John Albright, President and CEO of the company.  On the call with me is Mark Patten, our CFO; and Dan Smith, our General Counsel.

The company's actual future results may differ significantly from the matters discussed in these forward-looking statements.  We may not release revisions to these forward-looking statements to reflect changes after the statements were made.

Can you talk about what drove that?   Mark Patten   Real estate operational expenses. Well, I think, first and foremost – give me a second. The first piece would just be the fact that in adding Crossroads and Perimeter to large multi-tenant, that's one piece of the puzzle. Give me one second. If you got another question, I'll just look something up real quick.   Craig Kucera   Yes, that's fine. I just was curious because that makes sense. Time of those new acquisitions. I guess, certainly to the rent deferrals, were the categories fairly similar as far as where there was concentrated relative to what we saw with PINE, maybe a little heavy on entertainment, etc.? Any color there would be helpful.   John Albright   Yes. So Craig, it's John. Obviously, it's basically the categories that you would assume, restaurants, fitness, that sort of thing. I mean, we did have some very fairly large-cap companies that didn't pay, which we know we'll get payment from them one way or the other. So, it is some of the unexpected ones as well.   Craig Kucera   Got it. And just thinking about your liquidity, I know you improved things with the disposition of the CVS here early in the second quarter. Looking to dispose of assets, but with still little room left on the line of credit, is there any thought to maybe putting some fixed rate debt on some of the properties? Or do you feel pretty comfortable with sort of selling some additional assets to maintain your liquidity, to improve it?   John Albright   Yes. So obviously, we stacked a bunch of cash on the balance sheet, and we have Perimeter, which, as you know, we paid $75 million for unlevered, so we could easily go get $30 million, $40 million at very low leverage there. And so we do have lots of opportunity within the balance sheet. And as you notice, as far as putting fixed rate debt, we did basically proactively swap out the LIBOR on the credit line, which effectively gives us that fixed rate exposure or mitigates our floating rate and at a very favorable rate.  So, actually, we're able to effectuate a fixed rate financing at better rates than certainly the CMBS market, because as you know, the CMBS market is closed right now. And life companies are maybe a little bit active, but we certainly were able to get better rates just through the credit line.   Mark Patten   And Craig, by the way, let me come back to, If you don't mind, I'm sorry, I thought maybe you said income property. You meant real estate ops expense?   Craig Kucera   Yes, yes.   Mark Patten   Yes. So basically, that's a unique item. We have acquired some mitigation credits from the mitigation bank. And in connection with one of the land transactions, we basically conveyed some of those credits to the tune of about $1.5 million to the buyer of the land parcel.   Craig Kucera   And so those were more or less expensed then for the quarter. Is that the case?   Mark Patten   That's right. Yes. So it was really kind of a one-time unique thing related to a land deal. So it's not – in terms of real estate ops, we're probably not going to see much by way of expense there on a regular basis.   Craig Kucera   Okay. That makes sense because we weren't looking to that level of expense there. And then going to the potential for monetizing the loan portfolio, just can you give us some color there? I know that that was not really going to be a growth engine of CTO, but had been generating decent returns. Can you give us kind of some color on why you're thinking about maybe monetizing those today?   John Albright   Sure. Yes. I mean, look, they're high yielding. We like them, and they're all paying but the duration is less than a year on them. And so it's really about being ready for opportunistic investments where we can buy something that – very cheap or comparatively versus a couple of months ago, that would be an investment that we'll have for five or 10 years. So, it's really stacking more capital, being ready for real good opportunities.  I'll give you an example. There was a – when we were trying to, when we bought Perimeter, we were also pursuing another transaction of similar size, and that deal never sold for obvious reasons. And I think the institutional holder really wants to get out. So the price is probably going to be reduced fairly significantly. So, you're going to start seeing more and more of that. So, it's just really about being ready for those opportunities.   Craig Kucera   I got it. And when you think about making acquisitions sort of past what we're all going through right now, are you thinking maybe pivoting a little bit more into office because that has been a little bit more defensive? Or kind of how are you thinking about from that perspective and asset allocation?   John Albright   Yes. Certainly, we will definitely be more open to office than we have in the past. Not that office isn't going to come out of this unscathed, but certainly, having Wells Fargo as a very large tenant of ours and Fidelity. And just on a side note, it is in the press in New Mexico and Albuquerque that Fidelity is hiring additional people for their facility. And so yes, the General Dynamics property we have in Virginia.  Those type of assets, we certainly will be a lot more open to those assets as retail is going to go through the grinder coming up, but there's still going to be opportunity on the retail side. So for instance, Perimeter, this actually pandemic, so unfortunate as it is, is probably going to turn out to be a little bit of cycling out some tenants that we wanted out a little earlier than the plan, which is going to actually be better for the property. So, not all of retail is the same, I guess.   Craig Kucera   Right. Right. No, absolutely. And when you think about the types of assets that you're looking to sell, I think you noted in your presentation that they're going to be sort of low cap rate, single tenant, but are those skewed to any type of category? Or have you sort of soft circled what you're looking to sell?   John Albright   Yes, certainly. We're actively discussing on, for instance, our BofA in Monterey as ground lease. Certainly, with interest rates so low, those cap rates are going to be very accretive opportunities for us. Also, there's still some 1031 money out there. So, these are perfect 1031 sale candidates to buyers that have – need to place their capital.  We have, as you know, two Wawas, and those are perfect examples of very low cap rate ground leases. We have the Chase Bank ground lease in Jacksonville and some other things that we'll take this opportunity to cycle through that and just be more prepared for opportunities.   Mark Patten   Yes. Craig, you probably noticed that the – one of the Wawas is held for sale as of 3/31.   Craig Kucera   Great. Okay. I think that's it for me. Thank you, guys.   John Albright   Thank you, Craig.   Operator   Our next question will come from Craig Gilbert of Linden Advisors. Please proceed with your question.   Craig Gilbert   Thanks for taking my questions. The first one is just on the CARES Act. It doesn't seem like you've paid a lot of taxes in the past. Can you just talk about if there are any specific benefits that accrue to you from that?   John Albright   Yes. So great question, and thanks for being on the call. There are a few elements of the CARES Act where we really kind of don't benefit either directly or at all. The payroll tax, as an example, probably is the $19,000, $20,000 kind of opportunity for us in terms of deferring those taxes. The bigger one, frankly, is the carryback of the NOLs.  So, to the extent that for whatever reason, we have an opportunity in 2020, where we would have a loss that we could carry back, we could carry that back into 2018 or 2019 in terms of when we were a taxpayer. So that would be an opportunity.   Craig Gilbert   Okay. And I think you paid a couple of million dollars of taxes in those years total maybe. So, is that kind of the opportunity?   John Albright   Yes. That's actually a little bit above that, probably about $2.5 million.   Craig Gilbert   Okay. Okay. And for your multi-tenanted properties, do you have any co-tenancy provisions there that could result in more percentage of rents versus kind of what you – the fixed rents that you have right now?   Mark Patten   No, we don't. Not – we don't have that problem.   Craig Gilbert   Okay. And then the disclosure about the bank line about how you can – if there's no – if you don't receive rent, they can pull out properties, but you don't think that is triggered by deferrals. Can you speak a little bit more to that? Have you been in discussions with the banks over that? And is that – I guess, it doesn't sound like it's something you're concerned with, but any more color would be helpful.   John Albright   Absolutely. Great question. We definitely have been in discussions with the lenders to make sure we're on the same page with them, but we think that the intent of that provision is a property that's truly kind of in trouble as it relates to the tenant, where a deferral or any other kind of contractual adjustment where it's agreed upon by the two parties, basically, doesn't create a past due circumstance. And I think that's consistent with what we both are interested in.   Craig Gilbert   Okay. And for the folks that have deferred rents, are you seeing requests – is it more for deferrals? Or is it rent relief in general? I guess we've heard mixed – I think Burlington had a call, and I think they were talking about not just deferrals but also outright rent relief. And I didn't know that's one of your tenants.   John Albright   Majority of it's been deferrals. I mean, there may be one or two that have asked for free rent. But I mean, that's just really a nonstarter. There is absolutely no reason for that. So yes, there could be some that have asked for it, but most of them, the realistic ones have been deferrals.   Craig Gilbert   Okay. And the last question is just on capital allocation. It sounds like you're still going to be active trying to pick up properties, but what about share repurchases? Is that still something that you would opportunistically do?   John Albright   As you know, we do have still a buyback program in place, and it's something the board will – does consider each quarter. So, it's something that certainly is on the agenda to discuss.   Craig Gilbert   Okay. Thanks very much.   Operator   [Operator instructions] Our next question will come from Matt Werner of Chilton Capital. Please proceed with your question.   Matt Werner   Morning, guys. Just looking at the presentation, Page 7, specifically, appreciate the update on the guidance on recurring cash flow and NOI, but I was wondering what specifically was driving the lower cash outflow guidance? Number one. And number two, given the disclosures on rent collection, I'm guessing that NOI number is a GAAP number. I guess, what can we expect from a cash NOI number?   Mark Patten   Well, I think from a cash outflow side of things, probably, to a degree, it's going to be some interest. I'd say that actually, when you look at it, other than that, maybe the income taxes, but generally, it's been pretty in line with – it lines up with where we thought we would be in terms of just keeping that relatively flat, fixing the rate at 73 bips on our half of our credit facility is certainly helpful in that regard. Dropping the convert interest down to 3.875% versus 4.5% is really helpful in that regard. Buying back $5 million worth of that convert is helpful in that regard.  So, that's some of the pieces and parts. And NOI, I mean, we really try to drive this off of cash flow. So, on the NOI side, that's basically a pre-COVID. So basically, there's obviously adjustments, but I wanted to give you full flavor of the cash flow basically composition and then basically depending on these deferrals and how they all work out, whether it comes down off of that.   Matt Werner   Okay. That's helpful. I mean, I guess, how and when are you going to provide updates to what that actual cash ends up being? Is this going to be a – just a quarterly deal? Or when do some of these deferrals that potentially turn into rent relief start to flow through to that number?   Mark Patten   Yes. I think basically, we're in negotiations with these tenants almost every day. And so just so to you let you know, I mean, if we agree to a deferral, there's really something we're getting out of it. For instance, whether we're re-spreading that rent over the back half of the year or we're spreading it over 2020 – part of 2021, we're getting some sort of carry charge, some sort of interest rate on that.  So, we're making [a vig], if you will, or we're basically getting a lease extension. It could be and/or lease extension. And the lease extension, obviously, adds NPV value to the portfolio. So as we get kind of closer to wrapping this up, it's probably more of a next quarter kind of update. But if it – obviously, if we need to, we would give kind of an update before the quarter, but that's kind of where the posture is right now.   Matt Werner   Okay. And then just thinking – this is more of a general question for all retailers. I mean, if it is a deferral that has to be paid back in the next year or so, when these guys are starting to reopen varying times over the next few months, I guess, what do you think gives them the confidence that not only can they pay their current rent at the time, but also have the extra cash flow to be able to pay back rent plus some sort of vig on it?   Mark Patten   Yes. I mean, well, a lot of our tenants are, let's take on the restaurant side or something, Outback Chuy's. I mean, these are corporations that have liquidity. And so I don't really – like, for instance, Landshark, that I talked to the Margaritaville folks yesterday, and they basically did more business on takeout this last weekend than they do when the whole restaurant is open.  So, we're pretty confident that basically, people are going to be able to pay and get back there. Now look, there's going to be some that are losers and aren't going to perhaps reopen. But they're all very much something you can deal with. It's not – A, is not a huge rent payer and it's a good locations where other people would want to take it. It's really – it would be something where the concept is older and dated.  I mean, one example would be Macaroni Grill. I mean, there have been-after we bought that, we had so many brokers calling us because their clients wanted that location. If they don't make it, and assuming – we're fairly confident that somebody else is going to take that location. So they're – so it's all very case by case, but they're all very manageable and can be dealt with.   Matt Werner   Okay. That's helpful. And I appreciate the slides in the presentation as usual. Just thinking about liquidity of the company and you guys have given guidance on your debt targets as a percent of total enterprise value, which is obviously above the target, probably could argue that should be temporary, given the pullback in the stock price, but thinking about liquidity and going after acquisitions, how much is that factoring into your desire to go and grow the company despite having higher than [indiscernible].   Mark Patten   Yes, we're not going to grow by levering up, and we never really have done a lot of that. And so, it would really be driven by recycling proceeds, whether it's selling some loans or loans payoff or we're selling some of these 1031 assets that would need to be replaced. So, it's not an opportunity set where we think we are to lever up to take advantage of opportunities. So, the leverage will come down. We hope it will come down from the stock price getting close to even book value, but we won't count on that. So, we'll just be mindful of the leverage component.   Matt Werner   Okay. Great. That's all I had.   John Albright   Thanks, Matt.   Operator   This concludes our question-and-answer session. The conference has now concluded. Thank you very much for attending today’s presentation. You may now disconnect.	NotNews
Governor: Face covering order ‘went too far,’ was reversed  03 May 2020, 11:40 by The Associated Press  COLUMBUS, Ohio (AP) — An order for people to wear face coverings while in stores was reversed last week because it “went too far,” Ohio Gov. Mike DeWine said Sunday.  DeWine reversed the order Tuesday, saying many Ohioans saw it as “one government mandate too far” and saying face coverings were strongly recommended but would no longer be required. He repeated that sentiment Sunday on ABC’s “This Week,” calling it “a bridge too far” and saying, “People were not going to accept the government telling them what to do.”  “So my ability to communicate to the people of Ohio, frankly, I thought, was going to be really impeded and we would get hung up on the mandatory masks for someone going in as a customer and it just wasn’t going to work,” he said. “And so you got to know what you can do and what you can’t do.”  On Friday, the Republican governor extended the state shutdown until May 29 while also allowing retail stores to expand their business earlier than expected. He spoke as Ohio COVID-19 deaths topped 1,000 for the first time and as dozens of protesters of Ohio’s stay-at-home orders returned to the statehouse.  Construction companies, distributors, manufacturers and offices are allowed to reopen Monday, and retail businesses on May 12. Health care offices were allowed to reopen Friday. Bars and movie theaters remain closed, along with in-person dining at restaurants. Sporting events and concerts are still prohibited.  The governor said reopening Ohio is a “balancing” act between bringing the economy back while protecting people and added that he will be prepared to take action should the situation worsen again.  Advertising  The governor earlier said multiple working groups were being formed to come up with the best and safest way to restart activities, including hair care, dining out, going to the gym, visiting libraries and participating in sporting events.  “So when we open tomorrow in regard to a lot of businesses as well as office, it’s going to be based upon really best practices that were laid out by people in those businesses who do that,” he said Sunday.  Here are the latest coronavirus developments in Ohio:  CASES  Ohio state health officials say the number of confirmed and probable deaths associated with the coronavirus has now reached 1,038.  The Ohio health department posted figures Sunday indicating 957 confirmed deaths and another 81 probable deaths associated with the virus.  The department noted more than 19,000 confirmed cases of the virus and a probable total of more than 19,900.  For most people, the virus causes mild or moderate symptoms that clear up in a couple of weeks. Older adults and people with existing health problems are at higher risk of more severe illness, including pneumonia, or death.  ___  This story has been corrected to show that DeWine called the order “a bridge too far” on Sunday, not Tuesday.

"India's military salutes virus workers with rose petals, flypasts  03 May 2020, 11:40 by AFP     Petals fell on to the upturned faces of medical personnel clad in protective gear     An Indian navy ship anchored off the coast of Marina Beach, Chennai, is illuminated in tribute to people fighting the novel coronavirus    Helicopters showered masked health workers with rose petals and jets roared across the skies Sunday as India's military paid tribute to frontline workers battling the coronavirus pandemic.  In one of the first of several gestures on Sunday, petals fell on to the upturned faces of medical personnel clad in protective gear while an army band played patriotic tunes including ""Jai Ho"" (May victory prevail) from the popular ""Slumdog Millionaire"" film.  In several states and territories across the vast nation of 1.3 billion people, fighter jets and transport aircraft in formations took part in low-flying aerial salutes to thank the country's so-called ""corona warriors"".    Petals fell on to the upturned faces of medical personnel clad in protective gear Manjunath Kiran, AFP   ""The entire nation stands united in these challenging times,"" Defence Minister Rajnath Singh tweeted Sunday. He praised the ""commendable work"" of the ""frontline warriors"", including police who have been enforcing the nationwide virus lockdown in place since late March.  The navy lit up its ships off the sub-continent's shores when night fell, as part of the tributes.  The performances were the third public show of gratitude to health and other frontline workers, after Indians took part in nationwide clapping and lamp lighting efforts led by Prime Minister Narendra Modi on previous Sundays.  The lockdown was extended for another two weeks by the government on Friday, although some restrictions were lifted in regions that have lower numbers of virus cases.  India has recorded almost 40,000 coronavirus cases, including 1,301 deaths."	News

"French government extends state of health emergency until July 24  03 May 2020, 16:13 by Xinhua  PARIS: The French government has decided to extend the state of health emergency until July 24 to fight against the coronavirus pandemic, Minister of Health Olivier Vrran announced on Saturday.  The state of health emergency, installed since March 24, is to be extended because lifting it, as previously scheduled on May 23, ""would be premature"" as the risks of an epidemic resurgence are present, the minister told a press conference.  A bill on the extension of the state of health emergency will be debated next week in the Senate before being sent to the National Assembly, said government spokesperson Sibeth Ndiaye at the press conference.  Under the French law, a ""state of health emergency"" empowers the government to take special measures to restrict people's freedom of movement and rule by decree to requisition certain goods and services to fight against a health disaster.  France, one of the European countries hit most by the coronavirus pandemic, reported a death toll of 24,594 and 130,185 confirmed cases as of Friday.   Related Articles"	News

Northern govs mourn Rano emir, ex-Borno gov  03 May 2020, 16:13 by James Abraham   James Abraham, Jos   The Northern States Governors Forum has commiserated with the people and Government of Kano State and the Council of Traditional Rulers and Chiefs over the death of Emir of Rano, Alhaji Tafida Abubakar Ila Auta Bawo.  Chairman of the Forum and Governor of Plateau State, Simon Bako Lalong, in a statement on Sunday, described the death of the Emir as shocking and painful.  He said, “We mourn the passing of the Royal Father, whose words of wisdom, and pursuit for peace and tolerance stood him out and endeared him to his subjects and people outside his domain. His death surely creates a huge vacuum as it came at a time when Kano State and his subjects needed him most for the fight against COVID-19, which is a major challenge confronting the State and the nation.    READ ALSO: We’ll continue to see increase in COVID-19 cases — NCDC boss    Lalong urged Kano State Governor Abdullahi Umar Ganduje, the family of the late Royal Father, and the Emirate to be comforted by the legacies and good works of the deceased.  The Forum also prayed that the almighty God will forgive the shortcomings of the late Emir and grant his soul eternal rest.  Similarly, the Northern States Governors Forum condoled with the people and Government of Borno State over the passing of the first civilian Governor of the State, Alhaji Mohammed Goni, who died at the age of 78.  The Forum extolled his virtues of dedication, honesty, and sacrifice to the development of Borno State where he laid a solid foundation for growth and prosperity.  They recalled that as pioneer civilian Governor, late Alhaji Goni stood for good governance and prepared the ground for a strong democratic culture.  They extended their heartfelt sympathies to their colleague Governor Babagana Zullum and prayed that God will comfort his family and grant his soul eternal rest.	NotNews
Intel is reportedly close to buying transit app creator Moovit  03 May 2020, 16:13 by Jon Fingas  Intel’s autonomous driving ambitions may soon get a boost from a well-known app developer. Calcalist , The Marker and TechCrunch sources claim Intel is close to acquiring transit app developer Moovit in a deal that would be worth around $1 billion. The deal would reportedly fold Moovit into Intel’s Israeli automotive hub (currently led by Mobileye) and help with its overall self-driving strategy.  Moovit told TechCrunch it had no comment “at this time.” A deal is supposedly near enough that it could be unveiled within days.  It’s easy to see why Intel would be interested in Moovit, and not just because of existing financial backing. The startup uses a mix of AI and data analytics to monitor real-time traffic and offer transit directions to roughly 800 million people. That could be valuable for robotaxis and other driverless vehicles that need to consider live traffic to choose the fastest routes. If your Intel-powered ride avoids gridlock to reach your destination on time, you’ll know who to thank.	News
UK COVID-19 death toll up 315 to 28,446   03 May 2020, 17:37   LONDON (Reuters) - The United Kingdom’s death toll from COVID-19 rose to 28,446, an increase of 315, according to latest data on Sunday that includes hospitals and other settings like nursing homes.  The data, produced by the official Public Health England and its counterparts in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland, records the number of deaths in a 24-hour reporting period.  Earlier data on Sunday published by NHS England, the body which leads the state-funded health system in Britain’s most populous nation, said there had been 327 deaths reported by hospitals in England in the reporting period.  The discrepancy between these two totals is because the NHS England figure records the date when deaths are reported by hospitals, which is not necessarily the same day they occurred.  The UK-wide figures collated by Public Health England are based on when deaths occurred rather than when they were reported by hospitals.

Passenger plane brings 10m pairs of gloves for NHS   03 May 2020, 10:41    The flight is the second to land at Bournemouth Airport with NHS supplies.     Boxes containing surgical gloves for the NHS are unloaded from an Airbus A340 at Bournemouth Airport   A passenger plane has landed in the UK with 10 million pairs of surgical gloves for the NHS.  The Airbus A340 9H-EAL, with “Thank You NHS” written on its fuselage, arrived at Bournemouth Airport after picking up the supplies from Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia.  The aircraft, owned by Bournemouth-based European Aviation Group, touched down at around 8.15am on Sunday, with the boxes of gloves then passed to NHS supplier Crest Medical, based in Warrington, which commissioned the delivery.  Paul Stoddart, European Aviation’s chairman, told the PA news agency: “Today’s flight was a total success. Twenty million gloves, that’s 10 million pairs of gloves, delivered to Crest Medical and on their way to the NHS.  “Well done everyone.”    The plane lands at Bournemouth Airport (Andrew Matthews/PA)   The flight is the second to land at the airport with NHS supplies, after 120,000 surgical gowns were brought from Tianjin, China, on Tuesday.  Several more flights are scheduled to depart from Bournemouth over the next few weeks to bring back PPE.	News
"New Zealand calls for 'courage' from re-elected Beaumont   03 May 2020, 10:30   SYDNEY: New Zealand Rugby has called on newly re-elected World Rugby Chairman Bill Beaumont to take the courageous decisions necessary to ensure that elite rugby is sustainable for more than just a few nations.  Former England captain Beaumont won a second four-year term as head of the sport's global governing body by beating Argentine Augustin Pichot 28-23 in a ballot of the World Rugby Council with the result announced on Saturday.  Pichot, calling for root-and-branch change in the game with an emphasis on helping out developing nations, had attracted the support of the southern hemisphere powers but failed to make any headway in Europe.  NZR Chairman Brent Impey congratulated Beaumont on his success but said the 68-year-old must recognise that the short election campaign had revealed a huge appetite for change.  ""We are of course disappointed for Agustin Pichot as he had our vote, and it is important to us that whoever won the election will heed the calls for change to the game,"" he said in a statement.  ""There is still a level of governance reform that is overdue, and it would be good to see the courage taken to make the decisions needed to ensure the continued sustainability and success of rugby globally – not just for a limited number of unions and regions.""  Former Argentina scrumhalf Pichot, who has served as Beaumont's vice-chairman for the last four years, posted a short statement on Twitter.  ""Congratulations Bill!"" he wrote. ""Not this time, thanks to all for the support from the bottom of my heart.""  In his campaign manifesto, Beaumont had promised an independent review of World Rugby's governance and to spearhead the drive for a global calendar.  Critics will point to the make-up of the new Executive Committee, which was also elected in the ballot, as evidence of the need for change.  The 12-strong body included only three representatives from outside the game's traditional heartlands - a Tunisian and two Americans - with one of those the only woman.  Beaumont's first call after his re-election was for continued unity as the sport deals with impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, which has brought a stop to rugby around the world and caused major financial problems for unions big and small.

David Shapiro: Slow-footed governor leaves Hawaii’s unemployed hanging | Honolulu Star-Advertiser   03 May 2020, 10:05     CINDY ELLEN RUSSELL / CRUSSELL@STARADVERTISER.COM Gov. David Ige wore a mask prior to a press conference about the COVID-19 status at the state Capitol, April 14.   Painful to watch in the coronavirus pandemic is Gov. David Ige’s callous lack of urgency in getting unemployment checks to the more than 200,000 Hawaii workers left without income in the local economic shutdown.  A third of Hawaii’s workforce — second only to Nevada — lost their jobs as hotels, stores and restaurants closed their doors.  Yet between March 1 and April 26, the state Department of Labor and Industrial Relations paid only 65,252 of 225,394 unemployment claims filed as its staff, phones and online portal were overwhelmed.  It’s unconscionable that so many people desperate for help have suffered the added stress of encountering busy phones and unresponsive computers hundreds of times over days and weeks.  COVID-19 hit with unprecedented speed and disruption, and Ige can’t be blamed for not being immediately ready to deal with an exponential rise in unemployment from 2% to more than 30%.  But he and DLIR can be faulted for their plodding and inept efforts to overcome the challenges.  Ige had a virtual army of state workers sitting home with little to do who could have been deployed to help process unemployment claims. He had hundreds of phone lines in closed state offices that could have been repurposed for unemployment calls. He could have quickly marshaled computer expertise to work around antiquated systems.  The governor did none of these under his clear emergency powers, apparently worried about the response of public workers unions, which were consumed with demanding hazard pay for those still working and fending off pay cuts and furloughs as state tax revenues began to dip 20% or more.  The vacuum left the Legislature to take the lead in addressing the unemployment logjam.  Tired of Labor Director Scott Murakami’s weak excuses about why Ige hadn’t assigned idle state workers to process unemployment claims, legislators offered their own staffs and in some cases volunteered themselves.  Public union leaders wised up to the bad optics of whining about their own pay while doing little to help their unemployed brethren in the private sector, and “volunteers” from the idled ranks materialized.  Ige finally got on board and a call center staffed by 120 volunteer workers is taking shape at the Hawai‘i Convention Center to begin clearing unemployment claims. New online portals are helping reduce the computer glitches.  The job is far from over, with 60% of the claims still to be processed, the first $600 plus-up payments funded by the federal CARES Act just going out and the application process only now starting on benefits for unemployed gig workers authorized by Congress.  As more challenges inevitably emerge, it’s on Ige to utilize the considerable resources he commands to get these people expeditiously paid what they need to survive — and it shouldn’t take arm-twisting by frustrated legislators to supply the urgency.

UK chafes at COVID-19 death toll comparison with Italy  03 May 2020, 19:13 by Estelle Shirbon, William James  LONDON (Reuters) - The British government sought on Sunday to deflect questions over a coronavirus death toll that is Europe’s second worst after Italy, with officials saying it would take a long time before the full picture became clear.    UK had contingency plan for PM Johnson's death - The Sun The British government had a contingency plan for Prime Minister Boris Johnson's death as he battled COVID-19 in intensive care last month, he said in an interview with The Sun newspaper. Edward Baran reports.   Deaths rose to 28,446 as of May 2 - just short of Italy - increasing pressure on the government which has been accused of acting too slowly in the early stages of the outbreak.  Cabinet minister Michael Gove, leading a daily coronavirus briefing, sidestepped a question on whether many lives could have been saved if mass testing had been rolled out earlier.  “This government, like all governments, will have made mistakes, but it will be impossible to determine exactly which were the areas of greatest concern until some time in the future, when we have all the information that we need,” he said.   Related Coverage     Only the United States has suffered more deaths than Italy and Britain.  Ministers dislike comparisons of the headline death toll, saying that excess mortality - the number of deaths from all causes that exceed the average for the time of year - is a more meaningful metric.  The most recent available data showed there were almost 12,000 excess deaths in England and Wales in the week to April 17. Of these, just under 9,000 were linked on death certificates to the COVID-19 respiratory disease.

REUTERS/Henry Nicholls   CORONAVIRUS ‘LEAGUES’  Analysis by media including Sky News and the Financial Times suggests those figures are worse than other European countries including Italy.  However, the medical director of England’s health service, Stephen Powis, said during the briefing it would be some time before international comparisons of excess deaths could be made.  Earlier, the UK National Statistician Ian Diamond also cautioned against relying on rankings.  “I’m not saying that we’re at the bottom of any potential league table - it’s almost impossible to calculate a league table - but I’m not prepared to say that we’re heading for the top,” he told BBC News.  Prime Minister Boris Johnson, who returned to work on April 27 after a life-threatening, month-long battle with COVID-19, is due to announce later this week how the government plans to ease a lockdown since March 23 that has battered the economy.

Gove said a new system to impede any new outbreak by identifying people infected and warning those who had come close to them to self-isolate would be trialled this week on the Isle of Wight, off the southern English coast.  Addressing complaints by some health and care workers that they were still not being provided with sufficient personal protective equipment (PPE), Gove said French and German doctors had protested about similar problems.  “That doesn’t take away for a second from our responsibility to do even better, but it does mean I think that people recognise that this is a global challenge,” he said.

Mail Force saves VE Day for heroes: Vital PPE supplies will allow care home staff to hold party for veterans to mark 75th anniversary of victory in Europe  03 May 2020, 21:04 by Arthur Martin for the Daily Mail    Protective kit supplied by Mail Force will allow staff to put on a party on Friday to mark VE Day anniversary    Veterans including ex-POW Jim Hooper are elated because it could be the last major anniversary they see    More than 13,000 readers pledged money for essential kit needed by staff to tackle the coronavirus epidemic    Big backers include actor Sir Michael Caine and retail entrepreneur Sir Tom Hunter, who donated £100,000     Here’s how to help people impacted by Covid-19     They are the last of the valiant who fought for our freedom. But yesterday it was their turn to salute a new generation of heroes.  After weeks of being confined to their rooms in a home, a group of veterans can now celebrate VE Day together with their carers - thanks to Mail Force and the generosity of Daily Mail readers.  Vital protective kit supplied by the new charity will allow staff to safely put on a party on Friday to mark the 75th anniversary of the victory in Europe.  The veterans were particularly elated because it could be the last major anniversary of VE Day that they are part of.    After weeks of being confined to their rooms in a home, a group of veterans can now celebrate VE Day together with their carers - thanks to Mail Force and the generosity of Daily Mail readers (pictured, delivery of PPE at Greenways, East Sussex)     The veterans were particularly elated because it could be the last major anniversary of VE Day that they are part of. They include 98-year-old Jim Hooper (left, with Lesley Garven), a former staff sergeant in the Glider Pilot Regiment   They include 98-year-old Jim Hooper, a former staff sergeant in the Glider Pilot Regiment, who feared he would have to remember fallen comrades on his own in his room.  Mr Hooper, who fought in the Battle of Arnhem, said: 'This really is first class. I'm very grateful to everyone who has donated money and all the efforts to get the equipment here.'  Mail Force - launched last week by the Mail and its partners to tackle the PPE shortage - is attracting an extraordinary response from the public.  Contributions from Mail readers sailed past the £500,000 mark while philanthropist Sir Tom Hunter donated £100,000, taking the total raised to an incredible £5.1million.   In other developments yesterday:     The UK death toll rose by 315 to 28,446, just below Italy's total;    Boris Johnson revealed his doctors had been prepared to announce his death and said at one point he 'couldn't see a way out';    A new app to trace the 'contacts' of patients infected with coronavirus will be trialled on the Isle of Wight;    Key worker parents were urged to send their children to school over concerns that just 2 per cent are in the classroom;    A minister admitted more lives could have been saved if Britain had had greater testing capacity earlier in the crisis.    Mr Hooper, a father-of-three who lost his sight in 2013, and about 20 other veterans will honour the fallen at the special VE Day lunch.  Surrounded by bunting, they will eat sandwiches and sponge cake, and then sing Vera Lynn's most memorable songs. The care home in Brighton is run by Blind Veterans UK, a charity which supports former servicemen and woman who have lost their sight.   HERE'S HOW TO DONATE     Mail Force Charity has been launched with one aim to help support NHS staff, volunteers and care workers fight back against Covid-1 in the UK.  Mail Force is a separate charity established and supported by the Daily Mail and General Trust.  The money raised will fund essential equipment required by the NHS and care workers.  This equipment is vital in protecting the heroic staff whilst they perform their fantastic work in helping the UK overcome this pandemic.  If we raise more money than is needed for vital Covid-1 equipment, we will apply all funds to support the work of the NHS in other ways.  Click the button below to make a donation:   DONATE NOW   If the button is not visible, click here    Residents will receive a personal message from Sophie, Countess of Wessex, the charity's patron, on Friday.  'We now have effective protection from the coronavirus and I'm really looking forward to the occasion,' Mr Hooper said. 'I just hope I remember the words. I might even treat myself to a glass of wine.  'The Battle of Arnhem was a calamity. Most of the division got wiped out. I've attended a great many remembrance services in Arnhem and this time those that died will be remembered at this home.'  Mr Hooper was one of the 35,000 troops who landed in occupied Holland in what was then the largest airborne operation in history. He landed a large gilder - carrying 28 soldiers and weapons - 60 miles behind enemy lines in September 1944.  He fought for two days as an infantryman before becoming one of 6,500 Allied soldiers to be captured. Mr Hooper spent four months in a prisoner-of-war camp in Poland before being ordered to march west to a camp in the German city of Luckenwalde. Three months later, he escaped.  After the death of his wife Ann, he moved into the care home in 2018 and has enjoyed the camaraderie of fellow veterans. Since the outbreak, four of the 32 residents at Mr Hooper's home have died and six are in isolation after testing positive for coronavirus.  Staff say the residents did not catch the virus in the home and have put stringent infection control measures in place to protect colleagues and other veterans.  Like many other care homes across the UK, the centre's efforts to protect its residents has left it perilously short of PPE. Staff had three gowns left when Mail Force arrived with a consignment of bodysuits and masks on Saturday.  Without the new PPE, carers would not be able to move safely between the isolated residents who have Covid-19 and those who are allowed out of their rooms for Friday's party.    Mr Hooper (pictured as a POW in 1944), who fought in the Battle of Arnhem, said: 'This really is first class'   Lesley Garven, manager of the home, said: 'We're extraordinarily grateful for the donation from Mail Force. It's made us breathe a sigh of relief.  'For VE Day, like other days, we will be constantly having to change masks and aprons. But now we know that we have the rigorous protection that we need for our members who may have Covid-19... so a big thank you.'  After the first veteran contracted the virus in hospital, staff at the home had to work on the assumption that everyone else also had it, because they were unable to get everyone tested.  But this changed after the Government rolled out coronavirus testing facilities to all care home residents and staff.  Mrs Garven added: 'It's been very difficult to know if we had contagion within the centre because we haven't had testing. For weeks we had no idea who had it and who did not.  'It was an absolute nightmare and very difficult to manage.'  Despite the new extra supply of PPE, Mrs Garven said staff were taking no chances and will make sure residents are a safe distance from each other during the party.  Mail Force's campaign began in earnest only last Tuesday night, when it flew an airliner packed with 20 tons of personal protective equipment from Shanghai to London.  The £1million cargo filled the hold and cabin of the chartered airliner. The 50,000 medical coveralls and 100,000 masks quickly cleared customs and went straight to an NHS distribution centre in the Midlands.  After further checks, the first consignments were despatched to a hospital, an ambulance trust, a hospice and three care homes.  Thanks to the speed and scale of public support for Mail Force, plans are under way to bring in further airlifts of PPE.  Last night Cabinet Office Minister Michael Gove said the Government was increasing the supply of PPE to key workers.    Gove: 'Over 1bn items of PPE delivered in battle against Covid-19'    Delight at care home which can get through 700 masks in a day    By Neil Sears for the Daily Mail    On just one day, the staff at Lawnfield House could get through more than 700 masks.  So when Mail Force delivered 3,000 masks yesterday, they were understandably delighted.  So far the care home, which has 41 residents all with dementia, has remained coronavirus-free.  It means masks are necessary only for personal care and hygiene purposes, and when coughs and mystery illnesses give cause for concern.  But if a suspected case arrives, recommendations for the disposable face coverings to be thrown away after contact with any individual mean this home could get through hundreds.  As Mail Force, the independent charity supported by the Daily Mail and its partners, oversaw delivery of its latest consignment, senior care assistant at Lawnfield Darren Bailey, 40, said: 'We need more masks because we can never tell when a case of the virus will happen - and we need to be prepared.     Mail Force PPE Delivery: Darren Bailey, Daisy Calang, Cassetta Shorter and Adeline Munu, all Senior Case Assistants at the Lawnfield Residential Home in Brondesbury Park, North London, pictured with a week's supply of face masks    'So far we've stayed Covid-free because staff have been adhering to strict instructions - we don't wear our uniforms home, we change as soon as we get in, and we protect ourselves, our families and the residents.  'We've upped our hand hygiene, making sure we wash our hands at least every half hour, and making sure the residents do so before and after meals.  'These masks will help us do our best to keep the virus outside. The problem with PPE for residential homes like ours is that there are so many homes it is difficult to maintain supply.'  Lawnfield House, in Brondesbury Park, north-west London, is part of the MHA - Methodist Homes for the Aged - group, caring for council and personally funded residents, regardless of faith or belief.  This single group alone has some 90 care homes and 80 other schemes. At Lawnfield staff are already extra busy turning their hand to hairdressing through necessity.  On top of the 41 residents aged from their 60s to their 90s there are 17 sheltered flats next door when they sometimes have to lend a hand.  And helping vulnerable residents is a particular challenge when, with their dementia, they are struggling to understand the virus lockdown.  Mr Bailey said: 'Staff are going over-board to keep residents informed about the virus. That basically involves answering the same questions 50 times a day.  'We've explained to some of them that it's something like the Spanish Flu of a century ago, because some of them are aware what that was like.  'One of our personal problems meanwhile is that lots of shops are only open 8am to 8pm - and that's our day shift. We have to wait for a day off to go shopping.'  Senior care assistant Daisy Calang said: 'We already use masks and gloves for personal care, and those whose health we aren't sure of. We haven't had testing of course. And if the virus arrives here we could be using masks for every contact with every resident, which could be a couple of times a day, meaning we could get through 80 disposable masks a day each. That's why it's so important we have enough.'  Fellow senior care assistant Adeline Munu, a mother of two, said: 'The lockdown has been such a challenge.  'You could see the fear on the residents' faces when they discovered they wouldn't be able to see their loved ones. We've been helping them see them on FaceTime and Zoom over the internet.'    £500,000! Big-hearted Mail readers dig deep for PPE charity    By Mario Ledwith for the Daily Mail    Donations from Daily Mail readers to a new fund to supply NHS and care staff with lifesaving equipment soared beyond £500,000 last night.  More than 13,000 generous readers pledged money for the essential kit needed by frontline staff to tackle the coronavirus epidemic.  The astonishing sum was donated in just five days after the launch of Mail Force, an independent charity created by the Mail and its partners.  The flood of donations from both readers and public figures, such as the Duchess of Cornwall, took the fund to £5.1million last night.  Scottish businessman and philanthropist, Sir Tom Hunter, pledged £100,000 to the campaign, which was created specifically to tackle PPE shortages in the UK.    More than 13,000 generous readers pledged money for the essential kit needed by frontline staff to tackle the coronavirus epidemic, including actor Sir Michael Caine (pictured with Shakira Caine at Burlington Arcade, London, in May 2019)   Actor Sir Michael Caine, 87, became the latest high-profile figure to back the campaign, thanking the charity for doing 'a great job'.  He said: 'The job that you are doing at Mail Force is absolutely fabulous. It's exactly the sort of thing we should be doing in this country and it brings so much security to our NHS.'  It came after the charity's first consignment of personal protective equipment, weighing 20 tons and worth more than £1million, landed at Heathrow on Tuesday evening.  Since being checked over, much of the cargo of 50,000 medical coveralls and 100,000 masks has already been dispatched to a hospital, an ambulance trust, care homes and a hospice.  By last night, more than 13,000 readers had donated more than £540,000 on the charity's online fundraising page.  The total was reached just hours after Sir Brian Souter, the founder of transport firm Stagecoach, said he would match donations from readers up to £500,000.  One donating reader, Eric Gardner, wrote: 'For the NHS and the nurses and doctors, with thanks for all they do.'  Lynne wrote: 'We must all do our bit in these dreadfully frightening times. We need these dedicated people more than ever right now and I hope this helps in some way.'  Mail Force has also received 1,100 cheques in the post, while contributions from private benefactors and our partners have reached £4.16million.  Every donation, no matter how small, will be used to arrange for thousands more pieces of equipment to be airlifted to the UK for care staff as the coronavirus crisis continues.  If there is any money left over, the charity will use it to support the NHS and care workers in the best ways it can.  The Duchess of Cornwall joined two former prime ministers, Gordon Brown and Sir John Major, in backing the campaign last week.  Camilla, who has rallied behind NHS workers since her husband Prince Charles was diagnosed with Covid-19, described Mail Force as a 'magnificent campaign'.  The Daily Mail, whose proprietor is Viscount Rothermere, has provided £1million to the campaign. The Rothermere Foundation has given a further £150,000, while the Rothermere/Harmsworth family has donated £100,000.  Billionaire philanthropists Hans and Julia Rausing have donated £1million. Mr Rausing, 56, whose grandfather founded the food packaging firm Tetra Pak, and his wife Julia, have pledged £16.5million to more than 50 causes fighting coronavirus.  Tory grandee Michael Spencer donated £250,000 to Mail Force, describing the campaign to supply frontline staff with protective gear as 'a hugely important issue'.   Sir Tom Hunter donates £100k for NHS 'troops'     Retail entrepreneur Sir Tom Hunter donated £100,000 to the new Mail Force charity yesterday (pictured with his wife Lady Marion Hunter in Mayfair, London, May 2014)      By Arthur Martin for the Daily Mail    Retail entrepreneur Sir Tom Hunter donated £100,000 to the new Mail Force charity yesterday.  The philanthropist said he wanted to show his support to the NHS and care home sector after hearing first-hand accounts of conditions.  The 58-year-old Scottish businessman made the donation after discovering that NHS staff were being forced to wash and reuse their personal protective equipment, which can render it ineffective.  'This is like putting troops into battle without the right equipment,' he said yesterday. 'It's just unthinkable. And when I saw what Mail Force was doing, I realised you had a platform to make things happen.'  Sir Tom said he was moved to help by conversations he had with his nephew, who is a heart surgeon at St Bart's Hospital in London. He said: 'I was about to tuck into a steak and a nice bottle of wine and he sent me a picture of him in his scrubs as he was about to do heart surgery.  'He had been talking to me about PPE and said it's difficult here. Heart patients come in with a heart attack and you don't have time to test them for Covid-19, so the surgeons have got to do all surgery in full PPE which is exhausting.'  Sir Tom, who was knighted in 2005 for services to philanthropy and for entrepreneurship in Scotland, said he was delighted that Mail Force has been working with the Department of Health to seek fresh supplies of PPE.  'I think the whole country is really beginning to understand who is important and what is important,' he said. 'People who are perhaps invisible to others, like the cleaners, they are keeping the country going. They are absolutely vital. I hope that carries on beyond this terrible war we are fighting'.  Sir Tom, who is married to Marion and has three adult children, set up the Hunter Foundation in 1998, which has raised more than £80million for charity. He also set up the Kiltwalk fundraising platform which holds events across Scotland that charities can take part in.  Those taking part can raise funds for any charity of their choice. All funds raised are topped up by 50 per cent from the Hunter Foundation. This year, no one has been able to take part in organised walks, but the Kiltwalk fundraising is still taking place.  And this time, Sir Tom is matching every penny, so that double the amount is raised for the respective charities. So far this year, Kiltwalk has raised £750,000, which has been matched.    HERE'S HOW TO DONATE     Mail Force Charity has been launched with one aim to help support NHS staff, volunteers and care workers fight back against Covid-1 in the UK.  Mail Force is a separate charity established and supported by the Daily Mail and General Trust.  The money raised will fund essential equipment required by the NHS and care workers.  This equipment is vital in protecting the heroic staff whilst they perform their fantastic work in helping the UK overcome this pandemic.  If we raise more money than is needed for vital Covid-1 equipment, we will apply all funds to support the work of the NHS in other ways.

"Christ the Redeemer gets a mask against COVID-19  Projection on one of the world's most iconic monuments is part of a campaign to encourage the use of masks as a way of preventing the new coronavirus  03 May 2020, 21:28 by Todos pela Saúde  SÃO PAULO, May 3, 2020 /PRNewswire/ -- Used by many people on the streets of Brazil and the world today, a mask also covered the nose and mouth of the largest Brazilian icon: Christ the Redeemer. Part of the Todos pela Saúde (All for Health) initiative, an alliance of health experts created with the objective of combating the new coronavirus and its effects on Brazilian society, the action highlights the importance of protecting everyone when leaving home and amplifies the message #MaskSaves. The projection took place between 7 and 10 pm this Sunday (May, 3rd). A video with the projection can be found here: https://we.tl/t-Aw5RL82qC5    Christ the Redeemer gets mask to encourage the world protect against Covid-19” – Manu Silva   ""The Redemptive Christ presents itself once again as the ultimate symbol for the formation of a collective conscience for the preservation of life"", said Father Omar, rector of the Christ the Redeemer Sanctuary.  The use of protective masks has been one of the main recommendations of authorities to prevent the spread of the new coronavirus. The measure is in line with recent medical studies that prove the high transmission capacity of asymptomatic people, making it essential to use protection even for those who do not have fever, cough, headache or sore throat. Thus, the initiative is important to reduce the levels of contamination in social contact.  Todos pela Saúde (All for Health) The campaign to encourage the use of masks is part of the Todos pela Saúde initiative, created with the objective of combating the new coronavirus and its effects on Brazilian society. Comprising four axes - informing, protecting, caring and resuming - the initiative ranges from guidance and enhancement of existing initiatives to the purchase of health equipment, training of health professionals and purchase and distribution of inputs.  Itaú, the largest bank in Latin America, directed US$ 200 million to finance the creation and activities of Todos pela Saúde. The funds are being managed by a group of specialists led by doctor Paulo Chapchap, doctor in surgical clinic by the University of São Paulo and general director at Hospital Sírio Libanês, one of the largest in Brazil. This team is already defining actions to be financed, so that strategic decisions are supported by technical and scientific premises.  SOURCE Todos pela Saúde"	News
Boris Johnson urges countries to pull together in coronavirus battle   03 May 2020, 21:38     Prime Minister Boris Johnson. Credit: PA   Boris Johnson will urge countries to “pull together” and share their expertise as he co-hosts an international conference to drive the race for coronavirus treatments, tests and vaccines.  The Prime Minister will describe the challenge facing humanity as the “most urgent shared endeavour of our lifetimes”.  He will add: “We are in this together and together we will prevail.”     Almost half of doctors bought own PPE or relied on donations, BMA survey shows     Sorry, this content isn't available on your device.  Monday’s online pledging conference – co-hosted by the UK and eight other countries and organisations – aims to bring in more than £6.6 billion in funding to support the global response to the pandemic.  The UK has pledged to give £388 million in aid funding for research into tests, treatments and vaccines – part of a £744 million commitment to help end the pandemic and support the global economy.  Mr Johnson is expected to say: “To win this battle, we must work together to build an impregnable shield around all our people and that can only be achieved by developing and mass producing a vaccine.  “The more we pull together and share our expertise, the faster our scientists will succeed.  “The race to discover the vaccine to defeat this virus is not a competition between countries but the most urgent shared endeavour of our lifetimes.  “It’s humanity against the virus – we are in this together and together we will prevail.”     Coronavirus testing drops to 76,496 in a day, Gove confirms       Anne-Marie Trevelyan said the UK is ‘playing its part’ in stopping the spread of coronavirus Credit: Yui Mok/PA      UK coronavirus death toll rises by 315 to 28,446     Coronavirus has claimed more than 244,000 lives around the world, according to analysis by John Hopkins University.  The Government believes tackling the virus globally is crucial to preventing a second wave reemerging in the UK and it will speed up the creation of vaccines, tests and treatment.  International Development Secretary Anne-Marie Trevelyan said: “It is only by working together that we will prevent future waves of infection and end this pandemic as quickly as possible.  “By strengthening developing countries’ health systems and working to find a vaccine, the UK is playing its part in stopping the global spread of coronavirus to save lives everywhere and protect our NHS.”  Writing in The Independent newspaper on Sunday, the leaders of France, Germany, Italy and Norway and senior EU officials said the outbreak has “caused devastation and pain in all corners of the world”.  They said responding to the “global challenge” requires “bringing together the world’s best – and most prepared – minds to find the vaccines, treatments and therapies we need to make our world healthy again”.

"Noourbanographies of the Information Age: Your Real Estate Interior   03 May 2020, 07:35    Written by Hélène Frichot  May 03   Share Share   Facebook  Twitter  Pinterest  Whatsapp  Mail   Or https://www.archdaily.com/938709/noourbanographies-of-the-information-age-your-real-estate-interior Clipboard""COPY"" Copy   Can a collective agency, or mind, be traced across the urban condition? And how should we map its effects on the physical matter of our cities? A specific representation of a specific type of ‘home’ is employed as an exercise in defining the impact of a “logic of thinking that is both embodied and distributed, singular and collective.” Hélène Frichot’s proposal for “Noourbanographies” was written as a response to the call for papers of the “Eyes of the City,” well before our domestic interiors became the new public. Looking at the distance between hegemonic collectives and ecologies of subjectivities as space for action, the essay opens up to an articulate range of issues that involve matters of care, diagrammatic thinking and spaces of control.      For the 2019 Shenzhen Biennale of Urbanism\Architecture (UABB), titled ""Urban Interactions,"" (21 December 2019-8 March 2020) ArchDaily is working with the curators of the ""Eyes of the City"" section to stimulate a discussion on how new technologies might impact architecture and urban life. The contribution below is part of a series of scientific essays selected through the “Eyes of the City” call for papers, launched in preparation of the exhibitions: international scholars were asked to send their reflection in reaction to the statement by the curators Carlo Ratti Associati, Politecnico di Torino and SCUT , which you can read here .       A New Community    Noopolitics, which could easily be mistaken for ‘new’ politics depending on your pronunciation and who is listening to you, designates the politics of thinking at the scale of a population. The logic of thinking collectively, whether wittingly or unwittingly, is called noology, also defined as the logic of mind (noo designating nous, from the Greek for “mind” or “intellect”). Mind here must be imagined as scaled-up multiplicity. It must be understood less as an individuated, embodied attribute belonging to a specific, self-same, phenomenological subject than as a distributed effect. The effect of the collective process of thinking together, for instance, can express itself across a vast urban milieu. As you plunge into the seething data flows of advanced information societies your collaborative impact manifests as material admixtures across urban milieus from the container technologies of living apartments all the way to the character of neighbourhoods, as editorialized in the weekend papers, inflight magazines and on Trip Advisor. Amidst the flows and stoppages of information you are data augmented, you are a process of individuation and “dividual” both. You are rendered fleetingly sensible in relation to where you are, your environment-world.  You participate in a new community. Effects, by their nature, are fleeting, an effect of the light, an after-effect, likewise, the effects of provisionally delimited processes of individuation rendered as emergent (post)human subjectivities. To map the collaborative, if unintentional, effects of thinking together, to glean the passage of effects, their concomitant spatialities and material relationalities, some kind of method is required, a method that allows you to slow down. To follow the material impact of thinking together across an urban milieu, noourbanography will be offered here as a method, or rather, an unruly, non-exhaustive diagrammatic attempt at surveying something that appears to unfurl at near infinite speeds.    Takes You Directly to Sea World    Sea World, Shenzhen is: ‘An awesome place in China. There is a good place for relaxing and spending time on a holiday afternoon. The boat is actually a hotel and a bar. There’s a small fountain show every 30 minutes or so. Its [sic] good for family and couples’ [1]. (Google Search)  The urban milieu in question is Shenzhen , a megalopolis, and this immediately presents innumerable problems because as a researcher I am located at a geopolitical and socio-cultural distance. But does it really matter anymore who or where I am? To take the brief of the 2019 Shenzhen Biennale at its word, with the information age, with networked societies, the anthropocentric perspective has become radically augmented if not rendered redundant. Rather than multiple human eyes trained on the street securing its safety and well-being (which sounds rather panoptically ominous), a posthuman condition prevails. The “eyes of the city” predominate as buildings and streets themselves observe and react to urban life as it unfolds, just in time for your daily occupations. At least this is how a near future is imagined. Machines watching over machines of loving grace, and in the interstices, plugged-in, human subjectivities. I want to take this reorientation seriously by turning to the urban interiors that are exposed as so many spatial products across Shenzhen , so many portals into a multiplicity of lives, human and non-human. Processes of subjectivation are exposed across these interiors as the bare life of data: square metres, location, aspect, access, view, cost per calendar month. We cannot humanize these spaces any longer under the anachronistic signifier ‘home’, they are merely the spaces through which humans and non-humans pass, each reciprocally shaping the other. And yet…  This is not to assume that the human subject has been cast aside as so much unnecessary meat. Life, after all, is at least minimally facilitated here. In Signs and Machines, Maurizio Lazzarato explains the situation like this: Individuals – and here it is important to register that individuals are processes rather than ready-made and stabilized units – and “dividuals” a concept signed by Félix Guattari, work concurrently. Two entwined registers, individual and dividual: Where individuals are biopolitically organized or managed as populations according to their lives and their deaths, dividuals own a “statistical existence.” [2] Bound up in noology is the construction of subjectivity. Noology and biology, noopolitics and biopolitics, must be conceived in a continuous variation like the right and reverse side of the cloth of contemporary landscapes of digitalisation, informing a “cognitive architecture.” [3] The distinction Lazzarato makes between individuals and dividuals is presented in similar terms in Orit Halpern’s Beautiful Data, where she argues that networked communication from the postwar period onwards produces increasingly individuated (human) units. Space has become a new interface “radically individuated and simultaneously networked.” [4] The individual and dividual operate in what can be called disjunctive synthesis, differentiated as modes and yet developing in an intimate relay. What we have is the strange collaboration of networked dividuals and co-isolated individuals performing less according to imperatives of meaning and identity than process and environment, affect and behavior. [5]  It is worth returning to Lieven de Cauter’s eight concise laws of capsularization, where the apartment counts as an exemplary case. An inverse existential ratio takes hold, as described above: the more individuated, the more connected: “Closed off and plugged in entities.” [6] Or, to put it bluntly “the degree of capsularization is directly proportional to the growth of networks.” [7] What Cauter had to say fifteen years ago has only become more acute today. Peter Sloterdijk can be deployed to complement the analysis of capsular (non)relations, which he argues operate according to the paradoxical logic of co-isolation. [8] At least you share your cell wall. Pronouncing in his polemical style that the apartment and the stadium are the “most successful architectural innovations of the twentieth century” Sloterdijk asserts that the apartment can be situated as the individuated cell extraordinaire, supporting the creation of solitary dwellers “via individuated housing and media techniques.” [9] The spatial insistence of the cell or the capsule demonstrates that the disciplinary society is still at play amidst the newly emergent “control society.” [10] It is not as though you progress historically from one to the other. You share your cell walls and depend on their infrastructural interconnections. Even though you are bound up in your own ego-spherical containers, should the infrastructure fail you, you would be exposed to grave environmental peril.  In terms of what he identifies as the full-blown establishment of the capsular society Cauter proffers the extreme choice between Theme Park and Camp. [11] Your neighbourhood is prepared in advance of your arrival depending on the means available to you. 12.5% of spatial products available on one real estate website in October 2019 noted their proximity to Seaworld, either explicitly or in terms of access to the closest metro stop. Advertisements for rental apartments proclaiming the benefits of being in proximity to Seaworld speak of the allure of themed worlds within worlds. Enfolded hyperrealities. Not only do you live in a city whose population has expanded over 400 fold since the 1970s, but there are heterotopic zones within zones at work here expressing what Keller Easterling would call “dispositions” [12] that is to say, environmental encouragements to behave collectively in certain ways: Much as a ball rolls down an inclined plane, or a small child unselfconsciously expresses a happy or sad disposition.  This remote survey of Shenzhen residential real estate, undertaken in the month of October 2019 and reduced to that suite of products available to an Anglophone expatriate marketplace, will be necessarily partial, and certainly not impartial.    Western Style    This means that warnings are required. There is the risk of imposing my western style on a non-western milieu in organizing the available data. How am I apt to categorize the interior motifs I deem worthy of remarking upon from the privilege of my provisional stand-point (more or less white, Euro-Australian itinerant, second-generation migrant, researcher, pedagogue, woman, mother)? What will I not see? You must assume that for the most part the situation will remain obscured. So it goes: the enduring ignorance of partial vision.    No agent fees!    “We work with the newest technology to make the search and renting experience as seamless as possible.” [13] Much as the city thinks itself in more-than-human ways, it would appear that the city also sells itself across a proliferation of web-based platforms promising the seamless enjoyment of the property.  Lazzarato argues that it is perhaps property rights that “form the most successful individualizing apparatuses of subjectivation.” He argues that “Property is not only an apparatus for economic appropriation but also for the capture and exploitation of non-human subjectivities.” [14] Here, beyond the human, or with consideration for the more-than-human, environmental relations must be considered. A logic of property rights radically transforms environmental ecologies (constructed and otherwise).    100% real picture! 100% real price!    A general statement can be ventured: The home is a spatial product mobilized en masse. This real estate product is manufactured and mass-customized, but according to a delimited set of parameters.  The ways in which the interior is composed according to an “organisartorial” [15] logic presents the conceit of individual taste, where in fact the dressing of the interior, once analyzed across a larger data set of products, reveals recurring motifs, spatial platitudes, comforting signifiers you are bound to recognize.  Everyone knows by now that the real estate image is stage-managed. This is a well established contemporary Image of Thought. Spatial products facilitate the departures and returns of the “sedentary nomad” [16] that you are. Wide-angle lens photography and off-white walls offer a sense of space, beds are mussed, cushions are thrown, just the right amount of things – knick-knacks – are casually composed. This is what Helen Runting and I have called “white, wide, and scattered,” [17] which in the end only produces a kind of derangement of the indebted subject. All the mussing in the world will not relieve the anxiety and anticipation that plague you when you go in search of a real estate commodity. [18] Could this be real? Could this be me? Immediately processes of subjectivity collapse into the arrangement of the interior as you attempt to project your life into the comforts of the container. Is it possible to see through the cell wall? Or are you cursed to receive continuously varied feedback of your ego-broadcasted self-image? How will this life tally with your monthly income? And what, finally, of the environment outside?    High Floor, Low Floor    Socio-economic hierarchies are an inevitable part of the real estate game. Where are you on the ladder? Early in your career, or well developed? The search criteria locate you in advance of yourself: single, couple, older, with family. Location, location, location! The cost per square meter nearly always corresponds to what you get. Sometimes, curious exceptions occur. The 1 bedroom apartment that boasts a magnificent view and a large floor area (over 100m2) or the 3 bedroom apartment that is filled with someone else’s dirty laundry.  Of the 96 spatial products available in October 2019 on flatinchina.com, 39 were located in the proximity of the Dongjiaotou Metro, begging the question: What’s happening there? A ‘stub’ on Wikipedia explains that Dongjiatou was formerly an industrial area and is now largely residential. It can be found between Shekou (a free trade zone) and Houhai. Where Trip Advisor suggests there are at least 97 things you can do in Houhai, in Dongjiatou there are at least 144 things you can do, including visiting Seaworld, which is about 2km away.    Fig. 1: Your Real Estate Interior Noourbanographical Sample of single bedroom/studio apartments. Shenzhen, People’s Republic of China - Source: www.flatchina.com Accessed 16-17 October 2019.     Nice, nice, nice…    Real Estate arouses a collective affect. The mood of the market not only influences the circulation of spatial products, but where affect is defined as capacity the market ‘affectively’ enables some and disables others. While the logic of the real estate interior would appear to follow the inexorable drive toward keener individuation and co-isolation, at the same time when you multiply these units, affective effects – a capacity to affect and to be affected – are produced across the urban milieu. The interior, even if seemingly hermetically sealed off, produces a material impact on its surroundings, and the relationship is reciprocal. The material semiotics of the situation must be acknowledged. Donna Haraway explains that “material semiotics is always situated, someplace and not noplace, entangled and worldly.” [19] Even though it is tempting to survey these serial real estate images as disembodied effects, they are pegged to the mundane realities of daily life, alerting you to complex support systems, of which you too often remain ignorant.  The adjective “nice” plays a crucial role in the noourbanographical sample survey undertaken, numbering 96 apartments available in October 2019. Nice apartment, nice view, nice furniture. While etymologies are an old academic game, a sleight of hand even, when it comes to the anodyne word “nice” etymological play is irresistible: Nice reveals an Old French root as “simple, foolish, ignorant” and a Latin forbear in “ignorant, not knowing.”  Photographs of the one-bedroom apartments sometimes appear as though they have been taken with a mobile phone. The compositional framing is off-kilter, extraneous details come into focus, the lighting is murky. Also, beds are stripped of their dressing. Out of necessity refrigerators are positioned beside couches. At the same time, much is shared with the 2 and 3 bedroom apartments with respect to the interior accouterments. Pillows are thrown, potted plants and flowers are arranged.  Once you arrive at the three-bedroom apartments the recurrence of designer and faux designer furniture pieces is worth remarking upon. Feature ceiling lights. Brand name kitchen fittings. There are signs of more concerted and declarative styling. The apartments not only promise a “nice view” but visibly display an outside framed for landscape consumption. Mountains visible here, the sea there.  A survey of 2 and 3 bedroom apartments reveals a proliferation of black patches on living room walls. Flat screen televisual devices where the “nice view” flickers when you channel surf. Co-isolated, plugged-in.    Fig. 2: Your Real Estate Interior Noourbanographical Sample of two bedroom apartments. Shenzhen, People’s Republic of China - Source: www.flatchina.com Accessed 16-17 October 2019.     Nice View    The “nice view” can be further categorized under “sea” or “garden view”. In most cases the view is simply “nice”, but on rare occasions, it is “wonderful”, as in, a “wonderful sea view”. And on one occasion, at least, the quality of the view is rated as “fantastic.”  It is nearly twenty years ago now that Zoe Sofia (aka Sofoulis) published her essay Container Technologies in the feminist theory journal Hypatia , named for an ancient Greek philosopher, a woman who dared to think. She tells the story of the technologically augmented human expectation of endless supply, smoothly delivered amidst “facilitating environments.” [20] Her aim is to realign habitual associations of technology with what Cauter calls “hot machines” [21], projectile, fast, destructive. Instead, she draws attention to the container, the bowl, the preservative jar, the gunny sack, and relates containment to supply. Containment and supply provide support to (human) organisms, because: “The organism cannot be considered apart from the habitat that houses it.” [22] Drawing on the cyberneticist Gregory Bateson, and framing a noological thesis of her own, Sofia argues that the mind is immanent both to the body and to the ecological pathways and messages circulating outside the body. Individual minds collaborate forming a larger Mind or system, drawing attention to the fundamental role of the environmental milieu.  The nice view assumes a point of view on things, on a landscape, on what can be called a posthuman landscape of things. [23] This is not to assume the passing away of the human species (even though this is a highly likely future scenario) but the technological augmentation of the human subject as enfolded process of subjectification plugged into urbanized milieu.    Fig. 3: Your Real Estate Interior Noourbanographical Sample of three bedroom apartments. Shenzhen, People’s Republic of China - Source: www.flatchina.com Accessed 16-17 October 2019.   Your point of view is your opinion, and when we survey you, when a poll of a body politic is taken (like taking its temperature), we secure a read-out on a noopolitical situation: Populism, the rise of the right, terrorism, insecurity, interleaved with daily bouts of voracious consumption-production. Individuation processes spell out the collapse of social relationalities. Experiments in participatory forms only prove how incompetent you have become at getting along with each other.    Available Now    This noourbanographical survey is but a sample, an “irrational section cut” [24] through an immediate present. Each empty apartment awaits its next subject; they are capture devices that captivate and yet en masse they provide the necessary support systems for the endurance of a life. Noopolitics manifests as the bare life of data in the unholy hybrid of individual and dividual hooked into a reticulated network of stoppages and flows. “ The network obscures the capsule…We don’t live in the network, we live in capsules .” [25] And yet, can it be stated with such ease where life is supposed to be located? Is it not rather more distributed? Container technologies speak to the reticulated distribution of life, any life whatever, both containment and supply.  In closing, it is crucial to acknowledge a debt to other noourbanographical experiments. I also note in passing by way of explanatory remark that I have deliberately deployed the singular/plural personal pronoun ‘you’, for it carves out a vacated subject position. Who are you?  First, I acknowledge what I have learnt from the work of Helen Runting, also with the design studio Secretary International (Karin Matz, Rutger Sjögrim, Helen Runting). The critical design experiments they have been undertaking include the compilation of architectural data to make an account, for instance, of the “continuous surface of the welfare state.” [26] and before that – in an earlier studio formation called Svensk Standard – a cross-section through plans for multi-residential high-rise developments in Stockholm, Sweden in the year 2014. In Bygglovsboken the Svenk Standard team compiled what they call an “uncurated catalogue” of “Unfiltered raw data, cross-sectional exposé” [27] revealing the organization of the life of the interior. They construct architectural data-bases to render evident the outcomes of collective thinking at the scale of a local population. In such undertakings, including my own, the challenge of how best to ‘follow the material’ is a crucial consideration.  Second, in their recent critical design experiment commissioned for the 2018 Venice Biennale of Architecture, Alessandro Bosshard, Li Tavor, Matthew van der Ploeg, and Ani Vihervaa speculate on views of the distinctly Swiss “unfurnished interior”, which they artfully mash together in a multi-scalar fun-house spatial collage. The popular and award-winning Svizzera 240: House Tour project includes in its documentation an index of interior images, a database compiling a cross-section through the unfurnished interiors of the Swiss context. Ceiling heights range around a 240cm average, hence the title of their project, with two exceptions to prove the rule, ceilings of 360cm and 544cm. Drawing on amassed data their approach is one of critical demonstration. With this data, as they explain, “instead of representing building, they build representations.” [28] Beyond visualizing they manufacture spatio-material condensation machines of the contemporary (Swiss) interior. In the database of images of the unfurnished interiors, from which their spatial collage is derived, there is expressed a predominance of white walls, low ceilings, and a resounding emptiness. These qualities present the conceit of a blank canvas upon which to compose your life. But the key observation concerns the homogenous consistency, and the prevalence of the 240cm ceiling height: “what sort of norms, of preconceived ideas and feelings, are such images intended to convey?” [29] Less than any intention, there is simply effect produced, the unwitting spatial thinking-together of a localized population.  Even if adopted with regional variations, you can assume that such effects are globally multiplied. They are effects we are now obliged to environmentally contend with. Philosopher of science Isabelle Stengers often repeats the Deleuzian imperative: You must think by the milieu. [30] But what happens when the milieu begins to think you? Stengers warns of a coming barbarism in terms of our unthinking together. [31] Against this tide counter-moves are required that are environmental as well as cognitive: Think we must!

Seoul says Kim Jong Un not believed to have received surgery: Yonhap  Kim Jong Un, North Korea’s leader, reappeared after three weeks of disappearance.  03 May 2020, 07:54 by Agence France-Presse  North Korea’s Kim Jong Un is not believed to have received surgery, a senior South Korean official said Sunday, a day after Kim’s reappearance following a near three-week absence that triggered intense speculation about his health.  “Chairman Kim is not believed to have received surgery,” an unnamed senior official at the South’s presidential office said, according to Yonhap news agency.  “There were media reports speculating about Kim’s surgery, citing a change in the way he walks,” the official added, saying Seoul had enough grounds to draw the conclusion.  Rumours about Kim’s health have been swirling since his conspicuous no-show at April 15 celebrations for the birthday of his grandfather, the North’s founder -- the most important day in the country’s political calendar.  His absence triggered a series of fevered rumours and unconfirmed reports over his condition, while the United States and South Korea insisted they had no information to believe any of the conjecture was true.  North Korean state television showed Kim walking, smiling broadly and smoking a cigarette at what it said was the opening of a fertiliser factory on Friday.	News
Amnesty reports chilling details of Egypt press crackdown  03 May 2020, 00:02 by The Associated Press  CAIRO — Journalism in Egypt has effectively become a crime over the past four years, as authorities clamp down on media outlets and muzzle dissent, Amnesty International said in a report released Sunday.  As the number of coronavirus infections in Egypt continues to rise, the government is strengthening its control over information, the London-based rights group said, instead of upholding transparency during the public health crisis.  “The Egyptian authorities have made it very clear that anyone who challenges the official narrative will be severely punished,” said Philip Luther, Amnesty’s Middle East and North Africa director.  Amnesty documented 37 cases of journalists detained in the government’s escalating crackdown on press freedoms, many charged with “spreading false news” or “misusing social media” under a broad 2015 counterterrorism law that has expanded the definition of terror to include all kinds of dissent.  An Egyptian press officer did not respond to multiple calls seeking comment, but authorities have previously denied rights violations and justified arrests on national security grounds.  Following general-turned-president Abdel Fattah el-Sissi’s rise to power in 2013, most of Egypt’s television programs and newspapers have taken the government position and steered clear of criticism, or else disappeared. Many privately owned Egyptian news outlets have been quietly acquired by companies affiliated with the country’s intelligence service.  But even a pro-government voice hasn’t spared 12 journalists working for state-owned media outlets, who have landed in jail for expressing various private views on social media, the report said.  One of them is Atef Hasballah, editor-in-chief of the AlkararPress website. When he challenged the Health Ministry’s coronavirus case count on his Facebook page last month, he was promptly bundled into a police van and detained on suspicion of “joining a terrorist organization.”  Egypt’s public prosecutor warned in a recent statement that those who spread “false news” about the coronavirus may face up to five years imprisonment and steep fines. At least 12 individuals have been caught up in the COVID-19-motivated crackdown so far, according to Amnesty. Last month, authorities blocked a local news site that covered calls by activists to release political prisoners over fears of the coronavirus spreading in Egypt’s crowded prisons. Separately, Egypt expelled a correspondent for The Guardian newspaper over an article that indicated the coronavirus infection rate may be higher than officially reported.  The journalists interviewed by Amnesty reported increasingly direct state intervention in their coverage. Many working for government-owned or aligned papers said they receive specific instructions via WhatsApp on what to report and to omit. For instance, a directive on how to handle President Trump’s proposal to end the Israeli-Palestinian conflict this year asked reporters not to mention the plan’s violations of long-standing Arab policies, as Trump and el-Sissi have cultivated close ties.  Those who do not hew the official line, such as by praising prison conditions and smearing the state’s political opponents, “lost their jobs, were interrogated or imprisoned,” one journalist was quoted as saying. “I cannot even imagine that someone could refuse to comply.”  Marking World Press Freedom Day, Amnesty urged Egyptian authorities to halt their censorship, harassment and intimidation of journalists — and to release those detained “solely for carrying out their work.”  The Associated Press	News
What's Cooking: Tasty treats to try out this week  Cookery column  03 May 2020 by Lauren Taylor/PA   Baked Brie with blackcurrants, pecans, honey and herbs   Baked brie – gooey and straight from the oven – is the perfect crowd-pleaser if you’ve got guests round. This version by Elly McCausland pimps the classic with tangy blackcurrants, buttery pecans and fragrant herbs.  “I like to serve it with Scandinavian-style rye crackers but a good, crusty baguette is also an excellent vehicle for transporting cheese to mouth,” she says. “I highly recommend seeking out blackcurrant vinegar, but you could replace it with the more common raspberry vinegar, or a good, syrupy balsamic.”   Ingredients   Serves 4–6  45g pecan nuts  250g wedge of brie  70g fresh or frozen blackcurrants  2tsp thyme leaves or finely chopped rosemary needles  3tsp blackcurrant vinegar or balsamic vinegar  3–4tsp runny honey   Method   1. Pre-heat the oven to 190°C/170°C fan/gas mark 5.  2. Put the pecans in a small oven dish and place in the oven for eight minutes, until toasted. Remove (leave the oven on), set aside to cool, then roughly chop.  3. Take a small baking dish, the right size to fit the piece of brie snugly. Slice the brie horizontally in half (so you have two flat triangles). Put one half in the dish, cut side up. Take half the toasted pecans and press them gently into the cheese. Do the same with the blackcurrants (some will fall off the sides into the dish – that’s fine, but try to get as many as possible on the cheese). Sprinkle over half the thyme or rosemary, then drizzle over half the vinegar and half the honey.  4. Put the other piece of brie on top, rind side upwards (so you have essentially sandwiched the cheese back together as the wedge it was). Press the remaining pecans and blackcurrants onto the top of the cheese (again, some will fall off). Drizzle over the remaining vinegar and honey and sprinkle with the remaining thyme or rosemary.  5. Bake for 10–15 minutes, or until the cheese has melted and spread out a little in the dish. Remove from the oven, leave for five minutes, then dive in with crackers or good crusty bread.   Banana, tahini and white chocolate muffin recipe   Muffins are great to whip up at the weekend – so you can make your way through them in the week.  Elly McCausland says her recipe using banana, tahini, cardamom and white chocolate, results in a “highly addictive sweet-savoury combination” and is also an “excellent way to use up overripe bananas – the blacker the better”.   Ingredients   (Makes 12)  For the muffins:  200g plain flour  1tsp baking powder  1tsp bicarbonate of soda  Seeds from 8 cardamom pods, finely ground  1/4tsp sea salt flakes  100g white chocolate chips (or 1cm pieces of white chocolate)  3 large bananas, mashed  70g light brown soft sugar  1 egg  50g butter, melted and cooled  1tsp vanilla extract  60g tahini  For the tahini glaze:  2tbsp tahini  100g icing sugar  1tsp lemon juice  1tbsp sesame seeds (a mixture of black and white looks nice)   Method   1. Pre-heat the oven to 200°C/180°C fan/gas mark 6. Line a 12-hole muffin tray with paper cases (or grease thoroughly with some extra butter if you don’t have paper cases).  2. Sift together the flour, baking powder and bicarbonate of soda, then stir in the cardamom and salt. Stir in the white chocolate.  3. In a separate bowl, mash together the bananas, sugar, egg, melted butter, vanilla and tahini.  4. Mix the wet ingredients into the dry, being careful not to over-mix – this is the key to a light muffin. Divide between the 12 cases and bake the muffins for 20–25 minutes, until they spring back when pressed lightly with a finger.  5. Transfer the muffins in their cases to a wire rack to cool.  6. Make the glaze. In a small bowl, whisk together the tahini, icing sugar, lemon juice and two tablespoons of water. When the muffins are cool, spoon the glaze over the top. Sprinkle with the sesame seeds and leave for an hour or so for the glaze to set before eating (if you can wait!).   The Botanical Kitchen by Elly McCausland, photography by Polly Webster, is published by Bloomsbury Absolute.	NotNews

Sport  Death announced of former Thurles, Tipperary and Munster footballer Neil O'Dea  03 May 2020, 09:50 by Noel Dundon  Neil captained Thurles Crokes to win the only county senior football title for Thurles parish  The death of former Tipperary and Munster senior footballer Neil O'Dea has caused widespread regret in mid Tipperary and in Tuam where he has been resident for many years.  In his 90's, Neil had the distinction of being the only man from Thurles parish to lift the O'Dwyer Cup – the Tipperary county senior football crown – having captained Thurles Crokes to win the title in 1960.  Indeed, playing at half back alongside Paddy Doyle and Larry Keane, Neil was not only the captain of the side, but he was also the driving force and at 34 years of age at the time, he was hugely respected by all the players in a star studded team which included the likes of Tipperary hurling heroes Jimmy Doyle, Michael McElgunn, Sean McLoughlin and Blackie Keane – all muliptle county senior hurling championship medal winners with Thurles Sarsfields.  That title, won at the expense of Clonmel Commercial by 1-9 to 0-9 at Cashel on November 6 1960 was the first and only senior football championship title won by a team from the parish of the birthplace of the GAA – they had defeated the seven in a row seeking Loughmore Castleiney outfit in the mid final, after a replay by 2-3 to 0-3.       The Thurles Crokes team which won the county senior football title in 1960 led by the late Niall O'Dea    Neil also played for Tipperary having been drafted into the panel to play a challenge game against Kerry, when one of his direct opponents was the legendary Mick O'Connell. A few years later at the age of 28 he went on to make his debut for Munster in the Railway Cup when he played at midfield alongside John Dowling, who would go on to captain Kerry to win the Sam Maguire Cup later in the season. Neil was highly respected and regarded as a footballer – the seed of his skills no doubt having been sown and fostered in his native Templemore where he went to school in Templemore CBS. For a mid Tipp man to make a Tipp football team at the time, you had to be goon; for a Tipp man to make the Munster team at the time, you had to be very good. Neil was, and his contribution to club, county and province has been recognised many times since.  Neil worked with An Post and in 1974 he was transferred on promotion to Tuam in County Galway. He moved with his wife Tilly -nee O'Grady from Holycross and who herself came from great GAA stock – and they set up home in Tuam where they would spend the rest of their lives with their family and new found friends.  Neil was a man who believed in giving back to the GAA and he was soon submerged in the Tuam Stars club starting out in the juvenile ranks and going on to serve at every level including chairman of the club. The club posted a tribute to him this week stating: “ The very sad news reached us today of the passing of club great, Neil O'Dea. Neil, along with his wife Tilly, have for many years epitomised what is great about the GAA and Tuam Stars. Neil will be greatly missed by his family, wide circle of friends and the whole Tuam community.”  In Tipperary and Munster GAA ranks Neil  O'Dea is remembered very fondly as a talented footballer and a man of real drive. But, in Thurles he is extremely highly regarded and remembered as a mould-breaker who believed that Thurles Crokes could win the county championship, and who went about ensuring that the club would put its best foot forward in their bid to do so. They were greatly boosted by the fact that the Sarsfields senior hurling team had relinquished their hold on the county championship, having won five-in-a-row from 1955-'59, and those players were then available to play football – they would then go on to win five more titles in a row from 1961-'65 in a remarkable run of success.  Sympathy is tendered to the extended O'Dea family and the bereaved at their sad loss at this time.  Funeral arrangements for Neil will be announced later.	News
"Meet C9 TenZ - The first player to reach the highest Valorant rank  03 May 2020, 09:58 by Aditya   Cloud9 TenZ has now become the world's first Valorant player to reach their highest rank  TenZ is a retired CSGO professional who has recently made his switch to Valorant after signing in with Cloud9     C9 TenZ becomes the highest-ranked Valorant player.   Valorant ranks have recently made their way into the game. In a nutshell, ranks help categorize players according to their skill levels to create an even playing field for everyone.  A Former CS: GO player, who goes by the name C9 TenZ (c9 stands for Cloud9), has now left the Valorant community in shock by already reaching the highest rank in Valorant. C9 TenZ belongs to the North American (NA) region and has joined Cloud9 very recently.     The grind for this young sensation sure paid off when fans poured in thousands to his Twitch stream in order to witness the ""First"" highest-ranked player in Valorant. C9 TenZ made a recent transition from CS:GO to Valorant which can now be termed a ""smart move"".  In an interview with Redbull, C9 TenZ explains why he made the switch from CS:GO to Riot Games:  I’ve decided to go pro [in VALORANT] because when I was playing the beta, I realized I haven’t had as much fun as I was having in a long time,” TenZ said. “Although it might be seen as risky to switch games, I feel like the future of this game is very bright.”     This change has surely helped C9 TenZ scale his gaming career in two ways: As a Twitch streamer, and as a high-ranking Valorant player. However, with an achievement like this another set of challenges will surely be waiting for TenZ. Higher ranks in Valorant will ensure the young prodigy will match with many top tier pros, like shroud for instance, which could potentially pose a challenge to his future in the game.   Valorant servers coming up in Korea, Latin American and Brazil     In other news, Valorant has recently announced the addition of servers in Korea, Latin American, and Brazil .

"What This Former Pakistan Cricketer Said When Asked To Describe Virat Kohli In One Word  Mohammad Yousuf was full of praise for India captain Virat Kohli.  03 May 2020, 06:21 by Abhimanyu Bose  Former Pakistan batsman Mohammad Yousuf rated India captain Virat Kohli as ""No. 1 at the moment"" and said that the prolific right-hander is a great player. Yousuf, who represented Pakistan in 90 Tests and 288 One-day Internationals (ODIs), held a Q&A session on Twitter on Saturday. One user asked him to give one word for the Indian skipper. Although Yousuf did not stick to just one word to describe Kohli , he was full of praise for him. ""No 1 at the moment.great player,"" Yousuf tweeted in response.     Yousuf also rated legendary batsman Sachin Tendulkar as being better than the likes of Brian Lara and Ricky Ponting.

Marius Fransman brings Hollywood to SA  03 May 2020, 23:00 by Setumo Stone  Former ANC Western Cape chair Marius Fransman is making a comeback to public life – this time on a Hollywood ticket.  Fransman’s Moja Media, which owns the Brics TV news and information channel on digital satellite television provider StarSat, has teamed up with the Los Angeles-originated Fight to Fame group to bring combat sport tournaments and film production to South Africa, and to identify a new generation of action movie stars.  The deal with Hollywood group Fight to Fame BMS (blockchain technology, movies and sports) makes Fransman the official chairperson of the action star reality show in the country.  South African world boxing champion Chris van Heerden is also an ambassador for the combat sports and entertainment group, which recently expanded to Senegal.  Fransman served as deputy minister of international relations in former president Jacob Zuma’s government.  He was an MP, and he previously held the position of portfolio committee chairperson of higher education and training.  He was forced to quit politics after he was accused of a sexual assault that allegedly took place during a road trip to the ANC’s anniversary in North West in 2016.  The ANC suspended his membership for five years following a lengthy disciplinary process.  Speaking to City Press this week, Fransman said the temptation to propel himself back into the depths of politics – “something I can do in my sleep” – had always been there, but he preferred to chart a different course.  “We have a studio in Cape Town which is independent,” he said, adding that he would not accept funding – even from the government – “because it often comes with conditions”.  Two weeks ago, he came out of ICU after a Covid-19 scare. Fransman said he was looking forward to a new way of life after the deadly coronavirus global pandemic.  His wife had also tested positive, but her results later came back negative, “so I will wait a little more time before I go get a test again”, he said.  “As a Covid-19 survivor and someone with a deep, personal experience of the reality of this pandemic, I realise that, even after lockdown in South Africa and abroad, there will be a ‘new normal’; a change in lifestyle and the way we historically view events, tourism and economic activities in the entertainment industry.”  Fransman said the entertainment sector was facing major job losses and “the film and sports industry will have to find new and innovative means to re-engineer opportunities for business development and job creation”.  “Fight to Fame BMS creates such innovation and we call on top artists and business entities to join us in this exciting initiative,” he said.  Fransman said Moja Media had also signed a partnership agreement with Hollywood-based Cinema Libre Studio, part of the Fight to Fame group, creating the new entity Cinema Libre Studio SA, which would produce and distribute films in the country.  Its first project would be the co-production of A Chain of Voices, a high-budget feature film based on the bestselling novel by world-renowned South African author André Brink.  The screenplay was written by Jay Cocks, who wrote The Age of Innocence, Gangs of New York and Silence for Martin Scorsese.  A media statement by Moja Media said: “The film [A Chain of Voices] addresses the human element and the effect of colonial oppression on an indigenous population, as well as reflects on the brutality of slavery in Cape Town.  “Such a film is timely as South Africa grapples with socioeconomic issues regarding land and land dispossession, with current parliamentary debates happening around land expropriation, inequality in society and the pursuance of a more just and equitable society.”  Philippe Diaz, chairperson of Cinema Libre Studio, said: “Meeting [Fransman] is a dream come true. I bought the rights for André Brink’s novel – he was both a wonderful human being and a brilliant writer – almost 30 years ago and Martin Scorsese introduced me to Jay Cocks, who wrote a marvellous script.  “Unfortunately, I did not find the right partners as it had to be shot in South Africa.”  Fransman said he was excited about working with a global player.  “I believe that the co-productions we will embark on will assist many small entrepreneurs and actors from South Africa, propelling them on to the global stage,” Fransman said.

"Resorts are now offering virtual holidays  03 May 2020, 23:15 by Essential Baby  “Taking a moment here to reaffirm your intention,” intones Bali -based yoga teacher Nadine McNeil, from the Ubud studio that overlooks rice paddies and lush forest behind her. Apart from the camera operator, McNeil is alone. Though my loungeroom resembles nothing of the sunny, Balinese interior, I feel immersed in the space.  Since mid-March, McNeil's studio, The Yoga Barn, has been closed to guests. The studio began online classes via Facebook Live on April 2, enabling participants to make a voluntary donation via PayPal. In pre-COVID-19 times, The Yoga Barn offered 140 classes and workshops a week, each attracting up to 60 students. Nowadays the studio runs just a fraction of those classes, with fewer students. Still, says co-owner Meghan Pappenheim, a United States native, the launch of online classes has enriched their online brand.  ""We knew the virtual world of online wellness and self-help management was an opportunity,"" she says. ""We had staff available to co-ordinate production, programming and promotion so the donation model was favoured by teachers.""    Normally, The Yoga Barn would host 140 classes a week, including capoeira. Today, just a fraction of those are still running online.   Chiva-Som in Hua Hin, Thailand, has also transitioned its luxury wellness services to the digital space. Launching on April 16, Chiva-Som Online Wellness Services provide naturopaths, yoga teachers, fertility experts and functional movement trainers via video calls. Additionally, the luxury resort is sharing videos and recipes, virtual exercise programmes and tutorials on self-massage via its digital channels. The Online Wellness Services are complimentary until the end of May, requiring a reservation via their site.  General manager Vaipanya Kongkwanyuen says the services have been a popular way for clients to stay in touch with the resort.  ""They serve as a way to support general wellbeing, as well as introducing our wellness philosophy to those who have never visited us,"" he says. ""We anticipate this will help us attract a new audience once travel opens up again.""  The plan to continue the online services across their digital channels well after the pandemic has opened the wood-carved doors of Chiva-Som and The Yoga Barn to a new audience. It has enabled both venues to continue to employ their staff in the production and delivery of digital services.  Likewise, Airbnb Experiences has adapted quickly. It transitioned its tours, courses and excursions to the digital world, creating Online Experiences in mid-March. Hosts who had previously trekked clients through high tea in Scotland, taught visitors how to make curry in South Africa's Cape Malay, or provided art lessons in Oaxaca, Mexico, now appear via screen for virtual tutorials."

10 things you need to know this morning in Australia  03 May 2020, 23:28 by James Hennessy     Photo by Cameron Spencer/Getty Images    Good morning. Today we return to work amid continuing squabbles between federal and state governments on the contentious issue of schools. That’s what everyone is talking about today: schools.  1. Westpac has deferred its dividend after revealing a massive 70% slump in first half cash profit of $993 million. “This is the most difficult result Westpac has seen in many years. It is significantly impacted by higher impairment charges due to COVID-19, as well as notable items including the AUSTRAC provision,” CEO Peter King said. The bank reckons it remains “well provisioned and capitalised” but that it would be prudent to withhold a dividend given the uncertainty of the coming months.  2. Following a weekend of slightly relaxed coronavirus restrictions, NSW Premier Gladys Berejiklian said her state is “heading to get a bit of normality back in our lives” . Face-to-face learning is set to recommence next week in NSW schools.  3. The above comes as PM Scott Morrison continues to pressure Victorian Premier Daniel Andrews to fully reopen the state’s schools . Victorian schools was the nexus of the big political item of the weekend. Education Minister Dan Tehan popped up on the ABC to say Andrews had demonstrated a “failure of leadership” in his cautious approach to schools – but was forced to walk it back when just one hour later it was revealed a Melbourne primary school had shut because a teacher was diagnosed with COVID-19. Timing!     4. In case you missed it at the tail end of last week: Scott Morrison announced the decision on whether to relax Australia’s coronavirus restrictions will now be made on Friday – a week early. “Australians have earned an early mark,” Morrison said. (I’m reliably informed that ‘early mark’ is very much east coast parlance, and some parts of Australia don’t know what that means.) Again, Morrison stressed that any relaxation will be contingent on how many Australians download the COVIDSafe contact tracing app.  5. Australian capital city property prices grew by just 0.2% in April , the lowest growth since they stopped falling in June last year. Melbourne led the market lower, as prices fell 0.3%, while rents fell across all capital cities except Perth, according to CoreLogic. Forecasting 10% price falls , Commonwealth Bank economist Gareth Aird said CoreLogic’s numbers were lagging behind where the market is really headed.  6. Uber has rolled out a “temporary” service in Australia , which lets you book a car by the hour so you can get errands done – like going to the supermarket and the pharmacy in one trip. The ‘Hourly Driver’ service has a base rate of $59 an hour and you will be charged per minute thereafter. It’s available in Sydney, Melbourne, Perth, Adelaide, Brisbane and the Gold Coast.  7. Tech salaries in Australia have so far proved immune to the COVID-19 downturn.  These are the top paying startup jobs in Australia and how much they earn.  8. The US recorded its deadliest day during the coronavirus pandemic on Friday, according to new data released by the World Health Organisation . The organisation recorded 2,909 total coronavirus-related deaths in 24 hours. The figure comes as about half of US states have started easing their lockdown restrictions and others have announced plans to do so. One state, Mississippi, has backtracked on its plan to loosen restrictions after 20 people died in the state on Friday.  9. Normal life is slowly resuming in China, and the way its restaurants operate could provide a glimpse into the future for the rest of the world. Restaurants across China and Hong Kong have made drastic changes to the dining experience , and in many places, temperature checks, masks, and plastic partitions between diners are now the norm.  10. Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway sold the “big four” airline stocks in April, the famed investor revealed at Berkshire Hathaway’s annual meeting on Saturday . “It turned out I was wrong,” Buffett said about his decision to invest in American, Delta, United, and Southwest. Buffett warned that airline carriers could be left with “too many planes” if people fly less due to the coronavirus.   BONUS ITEM   In case you were getting ideas in lockdown.

"Dr. Samantha Hill Begins Term as President of the Ontario Medical Association   03 May 2020, 23:31   TORONTO, May 3, 2020 /CNW/ - Dr. Samantha Hill became the 139 th President of the Ontario Medical Association (OMA) today, pledging to advocate for and support Ontario's doctors so they can continue to provide the best possible patient care during and after the COVID-19 pandemic.     ""Ontario doctors are on the front lines of the COVID-19 pandemic, working hard and making many personal sacrifices to keep their patients safe and healthy,"" said Dr. Hill. ""I thank them from the bottom of my heart and I am inspired by their leadership, commitment and courage. I know these same qualities will prepare us for what comes next, while ensuring patient care is always front and centre.""

Dr. Hill succeeds Dr. Sohail Gandhi as OMA President.  Prior to the COVID-19 pandemic, the OMA was working closely with the provincial government and other health-care stakeholders to lead the transformation of Ontario's health-care system.  ""I will continue Dr. Gandhi's critical work to engage our grass root members, unify our members' efforts and ensure physicians continue to play a leadership role in health care transformation in Ontario,"" said Dr. Hill.

Coronavirus origin: Mike Pompeo points at Wuhan lab  Pompeo stopped short of saying the virus was man-made, saying that he agreed with a report by the Office of the Director of National Intelligence that ruled out genetic modification.  03 May 2020, 23:01 by Yashwant Raj  US Secretary of State Michael Pompeo has said that “enormous evidence” shows that the coronavirus outbreak began in a laboratory in Wuhan, China. He didn’t provide any proof for his claims, though.  “I can tell you that there is a significant amount of evidence that this came from that laboratory in Wuhan,” Pompeo said on ABC’s This Week. “These are not the first times that we’ve had a world exposed to viruses as a result of failures in a Chinese lab.”  Pompeo stopped short of saying the virus was man-made, saying that he agreed with a report by the Office of the Director of National Intelligence that ruled out genetic modification.  “I’ve seen what the intelligence community has said,” said Pompeo. “I have no reason to believe that they’ve got it wrong.”  Meanwhile, prisons in the US that hold the world’s largest number of incarcerated people have been tormented by a wave of coronavirus infections and fatalities.  More than 14,400 inmates have been infected and some 215 have died, said Marshall Project, a non-partisan news organisation. Official numbers from the Bureau of Prions showed 1,919 cases and 37 fatalities.	NotNews
Stockholm Retirement Home to Be Turned Into Migrant Apartments  03 May 2020, 12:24 by Chris Tomlinson  A retirement home in the Swedish capital of Stockholm that is currently awaiting renovations will be turned into apartments for newly-arrived migrants.  Initially, the residents of the building, which has 63 apartments in total, were moved out only temporarily due to expected renovations last winter, leaving it empty.  Delays have meant the work may not start until the Autumn of 2021 — and the owners of the property have decided to rent the apartments to the Stockholm housing authority, who will look to rent the apartments to newly-arrived migrants.  The migrants will rent the apartments on a temporary basis when they first come to Sweden and will supposedly be expected to procure their own accommodation once they are established.  Whether the original elderly residents will ever get to return to the property is not clear.     Anna Mölgård, the co-ordinator for new arrivals, said: “The need for housing for designated new arrivals according to the Settlement Act really exists. We also have quite a few people already living in Stockholm who are completing their establishment program but have not finished it and have not found their own home yet. They may need to move on when their lease expires.”  While Sweden has seen a reduction in asylum seekers and illegal immigrants due to the travel disruption caused by the Chinese coronavirus, Stockholm still expects at least 800 new migrants — and Swedish authorities may be forced to release those set for deportation as well.  Other areas in Sweden have housed migrants in homes for the elderly in the past. In 2017, for example, the municipality of Ekerö said it would look to house migrants in a retirement home that was not at capacity.  Anders Anagrius, the regional integration manager, said at the time that the move would be a positive experience for both the migrants and the existing elderly residents.

'A buying spree of epic proportions': How the Federal Reserve bucked precedent and forever changed its role in the US economy, Business Insider - Business Insider Singapore  03 May 2020, 12:15 by Ben Winck, Business Insider US    The Federal Reserve’s rapid balance sheet expansion and move into corporate bond purchases has seen the central bank trade its independence from markets for a “whatever it takes” attitude.    The coronavirus pandemic plunged the US economy into an unprecedented recession over just two months, forcing the central bank to employ a range of new tools to avoid complete economic collapse.    Experts warn that corporate bond purchases could make economic recovery more chaotic than usual, as they directly influence market valuations and dull risks associated with junk-rated debt.    The size of the Fed’s intervention poses its own issues, experts say. Unwinding trillions of dollars in aid too early can drive volatility higher, while acting too late risks disinflation.    Visit the Business Insider homepage for more stories .    The Federal Reserve is no longer the central bank it used to be.  In a matter of weeks, the steadily expanding US economy slipped into its worst recession in nearly a century. Tens of millions of Americans lost their jobs , spending froze, and credit health tanked. While the Fed’s response began with its traditional financial-crisis playbook – pushing interest rates to the floor and buying Treasurys and mortgage-backed securities – a shift was brewing.  Then, on March 20, the monetary authority’s role changed. The Fed announced it would begin buying corporate bonds for the first time in its 107-year history, offering aid for cash-strapped businesses large and small. That facility marked a paradigm shift to the central bank’s code and separated the Fed from its originally intended role in the US economy.  “The big concern is that the line between the function of the Fed and the Treasury is getting blurred,” Bruce Mizrach, professor of economics at Rutgers University, said, adding past bailouts, commercial or municipal, were handled by the latter and not the former.  He added: “That’s a larger function than what was envisioned for the Fed, and once you assume those responsibilities, it then becomes harder to back away.”  Risks in uncharted territory  Until the financial crisis, the Fed’s primary tool was its benchmark interest rate. When the 2008 meltdown hit and rates were pushed to zero, the Fed turned to the purchase of mortgage-backed securities and other unconventional assets.  To combat the coronavirus downturn the central bank expanded its toolbox once more. The Fed’s corporate bond purchases were initially exclusive to investment-grade debt before an expansion incorporated so-called fallen angels, companies that recently slipped from high-quality ratings to junk status.  “The use of high-yield purchases is designed explicitly to say, ‘look, if you were an investment-grade company before March 223 and you got downgraded because of COVID, that shouldn’t have happened,'” Lauren Goodwin, economist at New York Life Investments, said in an interview.  The Fed’s own leaders have acknowledged the shift, with Dallas branch president Robert Kaplan telling Fox Business on Friday that the bank’s role includes serving as “ a lender of last resort .”   Read more:  An investing strategy called ‘crisis alpha’ designed to thrive during meltdowns just whiffed on the fastest bear market in history. Here’s how that’s upended a $318 billion industry – and what it means for the future.   Still, experts worry that the move into risky debt purchases will make an eventual recovery more turbulent than usual. The Fed doesn’t want to be seen as impeding market dynamics, but its move from stable Treasury bonds to corporate credit has already changed valuations across the board.  In the days following the Fed’s March 23 announcement, corporate bonds retraced sharp declines. The stock market enjoyed an indirect boost, as investors viewed the policy as a strong backstop for risk assets.  “The problem with official intervention in markets is you’re no longer letting the market determine prices. So what is the right valuation?” Vincent Reinhart, chief economist at BNY Mellon, said, adding “the possibility that the Fed will broaden the scope of its interventions” is even affecting prices in sectors ineligible for Fed lending.  Even if market valuations normalize and account for the Fed’s policy, closing its facilities in the wake of the economic downturn will drive violent price swings all over again, Goodwin warned.  “The rollback of these programs and the timing of that rollback is going to be an enormous focus for investors and it will absolutely prompt market volatility,” she said.  The long unwinding  Where some are worried about the scope of the Fed’s latest measures, others point to their size as a serious long-term risk.  Through quantitative easing programs from 2010 to 2015, the Fed’s balance sheet roughly doubled to $4.5 trillion. It took until September 2019 to unwind about $800 billion from its balance sheet, yet the subsequent repo crisis and coronavirus pandemic undid four years of progress in a matter of weeks. From February 24 to April 27, the Fed added another $2.5 trillion to its balance sheet.  The race to pad markets resulted in “a buying spree of epic proportions,” JPMorgan economists wrote in a Tuesday note. The central bank’s purchases show no signs of stopping, with five of its nine lending facilities yet to begin operations. Experts expect the Fed’s holdings to land between $7 trillion $10 trillion by the end of the year, dwarfing the expansion seen during the financial crisis.   Read more:  Famed economist David Rosenberg nailed the housing crash. Now he says this crisis won’t end as quickly as it began and shares an investing strategy for the next 3 years and beyond.   Reversing the balance sheet explosion poses its own threat. Shrinking it before the economy has stabilized could drive price volatility and impede the Fed’s efforts to avoid market influence, Reinhart said. He also noted that acting too late puts the environment at risk of deflation, where prices stop increasing at a healthy rate.  The central bank must also gain approval from the Treasury to close its lending facilities, and the department’s leaders may decide against pulling back on corporate aid.  “Facilities are going to be tough to unwind and they will linger. They are going to wait until it’s absolutely the case that the economy is on solid footing and the expansion is underway,” Reinhart said.  Return to normalcy  There’s still hope among experts that the Fed can return to its independent, market-independent state. Much of the Fed’s emergency measures were made at the behest of Congress and the Treasury. Placing the onus on elected officials leaves the Fed and its appointed leaders from venturing too far out of its historic jurisdiction, Goodwin said.  “If you think this is a huge overstep and you’re worried about free markets, it’s really important to know this isn’t just the Fed acting on its own,” Goodwin said.  He concluded: “The next crisis will probably look different. What policymakers have shown is not only that they can be creative in addressing an acute market functioning issue … but that they’re willing to adapt and adjust the policies as necessary.”    Now read more markets coverage from Markets Insider and Business Insider:       Goldman Sachs traders made more than $100 million on 14 separate days amid the first quarter’s fierce volatility        The Fed expands its $600 billion lending program for struggling businesses but leaves start date unannounced        Quant megafund AQR explains why investors should be more worried about prolonged slumps than virus-style crashes – and details a 3-part process for protecting against them	NotNews
India’s military salutes virus workers with rose petals, flypasts   03 May 2020, 12:45   NEW DELHI, May 3 — Helicopters showered masked health workers with rose petals and jets roared across the skies Sunday as India’s military paid tribute to frontline workers battling the coronavirus pandemic.  In one of the first of several gestures on Sunday, petals fell on to the upturned faces of medical personnel clad in protective gear as an army band played patriotic tunes including “Jai Ho” (May victory prevail) from the popular Slumdog Millionaire film.  In several states and territories across the vast nation of 1.3 billion people, fighter jets and transport aircraft in formations took part in low-flying aerial salutes to thank the country’s so-called “corona warriors”.  “The entire nation stands united in these challenging times,” Defence Minister Rajnath Singh tweeted Sunday as he praised the “commendable work” of the “frontline warriors”, including police which have been enforcing the nationwide virus lockdown in place since late March.  The navy will light up its ships off the sub-continent’s shores when night falls as part of the tributes.  The performances were the third public show of gratitude to health and other frontline workers, after Indians took part in nationwide clapping and lamp lighting efforts led by Prime Minister Narendra Modi on previous Sundays.  The lockdown was extended for another two weeks by the government on Friday, although some restrictions were lifted in regions that have lower numbers of virus cases.  India has recorded almost 40,000 coronavirus cases, including 1,301 deaths. — AFP   Related Articles	News
IDF Captures 5 Sudanese Infiltrators on Lebanon Border  03 May 2020, 12:02 by TPS / Tazpit News Agency  The IDF arrested five Sudanese citizens who attempted to cross into Israel from Lebanon on Saturday night, the army stated.  “During the night, IDF forces detected five suspects who tried to cross from Lebanon into Israeli territory. The suspects were apprehended during the crossing attempt on the perimeter fence,” an IDF spokesperson stated.  No one was injured in the incident. The five were returned to Lebanon.  Israel in recent years has become a sought-after destination by work migrants from Africa, coming primarily through Egypt. Israel in recent years has built a fence along the Egyptian border to block the flow of work migrants, bringing down the number of infiltrators annually from thousands to a mere few.  It appears that the African work migrants are seeking new ways to illegally enter the country.   RELATED ARTICLES	News
There’s Only 1 Major NFL Quarterback “Domino” Left To Fall  03 May 2020, 12:09 by Andrew Holleran  The 2020 NFL offseason has been an extremely eventful one for the league’s quarterbacks.  From Tom Brady leaving New England for Tampa Bay to Philip Rivers signing with the Colts to Jameis Winston latching on in New Orleans, several of the league’s big-name QBs have been on the move so far this offseason.  Another notable move happened on Saturday night. Longtime Cincinnati Bengals quarterback Andy Dalton signed a one-year deal in Dallas .  This leaves just one major NFL quarterback “domino” still needing to fall, as noted by ESPN NFL insider Field Yates.  “And now we wait for the last major QB domino to fall: Cam Newton,” he wrote following Dalton’s signing with the Cowboys.     There isn’t much known regarding Newton’s impending decision.  The former No. 1 overall NFL Draft pick was released by the Carolina Panthers last month. He’s been linked to a couple of different teams – New England, Jacksonville – but it’s unclear who really has interest.  It’s possible Newton will choose to wait until training camp/preseason begins. There is likely to be a quarterback injury or two and Newton could sign with whatever team ends up needing a healthy quarterback.	NotNews

"The thought of facing Lee took my sleep away, don't want to face Hazlewood now: Rohit Sharma  03 May 2020, 13:04 by PTI  The thought of standing up to Brett Lee's thunderbolts had taken Rohit Sharma's ""sleep away"" when he first started out but among the current lot, Josh Hazlewood is one speedster the India swashbuckler ""doesn't want to face"" in Tests.  Rohit said he will have to be mentally prepared to face Hazlewood when India tour Australia for a Test series later this year, provided the COVID-19 pandemic subsides.  Asked to name the toughest pacers he has faced so far, Rohit said, ""One bowler is Brett Lee because he didn't let me sleep the previous night on my first tour to Australia in 2007, as I was thinking how to play this bowler who bowls in excess of 150 kmph.""  ""In 2007, Brett Lee was at his peak. I used to watch him closely and noticed that he was consistently bowling at the speed of around 150-155 kmph. The thought of a youngster like me facing that kind of speed took away my sleep,"" Rohit said of the former Australian speed merchant on Star Sports' 'Cricket Connected'.  Since making his debut in 2007 as a precocious talent, Rohit has gone on to become one of the world's most prolific batsmen, and his exploits in limited overs cricket are second to none.  Rohit has racked up 29 ODI hundreds and six centuries in Test cricket, besides four three-figure mark in the T20 Internationals.  ""Currently, someone whom I don't want to face in Test cricket would be Josh Hazlewood because he's disciplined and does not move away from that length. He does not give you loose balls,"" he said.  Among the retired lot, Rohit said South African pace great Dale Steyn has also given him nightmares because of his ability to swing the ball at great speed.  ""I have two retired favourite bowlers who I never wanted to face, one was Brett Lee and the other was Dale Steyn. I never wanted to face Steyn because playing pace and swing at the same time was a nightmare, it was just unreal.""  Rohit said he continues to face quality bowlers in the present day with Hazlewood being among the best .  ""I have watched him enough to understand that. I know for a fact that if I have to go to Australia to play a Test, then I have to be mentally prepared to be disciplined while facing Josh,"" said the scorer of three double hundreds in ODIs.

Senators accuse Lusaka of disobeying House protocol  03 May 2020, 13:42 by DAVID MWERE  In Summary   The Senators claim that the rules developed by Senate Speaker Ken Lusaka to guide the business of the House during this Covid-19 pandemic crisis period violated Constitution.  They argue that the rules gave Senate leader of majority Kipchumba Murkomen and deputy leader of minority Cleophas Malala undue advantage to vote for their colleagues.   The Senate is on the spot for violating its own Standing Orders and the constitution when it sat on April 21, 2020, to take a vote on three key Bills.  The Sunday Nation has since established that a group of Senators not happy with the manner in which business was conducted in the House but who cannot be named for fear of reprimand from the Speaker, are planning to sponsor a Kenyan to file a petition in court to challenge the passage of the three bills.  The Bills at the centre of the dispute include the two County Governments (Amendment) Bills of 2017, and the Division of Revenue Bill 2020, which President Uhuru Kenyatta has since been signed into law.  The Senators claim that the rules developed by Senate Speaker Ken Lusaka to guide the business of the House during this Covid-19 pandemic crisis period violated Articles 122 and 123 of the Constitution.  They argue that the rules gave Senate leader of majority Kipchumba Murkomen and deputy leader of minority Cleophas Malala (Kakamega) undue advantage to vote for their colleagues as the House was adopting the three bills.  “Murkomen and Malala voted for Senators who did not even step within parliament precincts. When did the two become “each Senator shall vote” as proclaimed by the constitution? What if it emerges that the Senators they voted for may have actually admitted in the hospital?” a Senator, who did not want to go on record, wondered.  The Covid-19 pandemic has seen the number of Senators and MPs allowed in their respective debating chambers limited as a caution to check its spread after the country adopted the social-distancing protocol.  Interestingly, all the 47 heads of county delegations (the elected Senators) required to take a vote on a matter that concerns counties including the three Bills, voted.  On a normal day, it has been difficult to register such votes as many elected Senators do not attend House proceedings. They have also failed to delegate to their county delegations.  Mr Lusaka’s guidelines provide that a Senator shall be considered and reckoned to have attended and to be present during the Covid-19 crisis period if the Senator has come to the precincts of parliament for purposes of the sitting or is at the Senator's office within the precincts of parliament.  The rules further indicate that the Senator shall be present if he or she has been recorded and certified by the Clerk to be present.  According to Mr Lusaka, a Senator decreed to be present shall communicate his or her vote in writing to the Senate majority leader or the minority leader or to a Senator designated for that purpose (vote), may communicate using email or text message.  “Whenever a question is put on a matter concerning counties, the majority and the minority or Senator designated for that purpose, shall when called upon to do so by the Speaker, verbally state the vote of their respective side,” the guidelines state.  The Senators opposed to these rules argue that while voting in parliament is physical, this provision may have seen some register their presence and immediately disappear from parliament but still, end up being voted for as decreed by the rules.  They also claim that Speaker Lusaka may have applied the Senate’s Standing Order No. 1 beyond its limit.  Standing Orders are a set of rules that guide how business is to be conducted in parliament.  The National Assembly and Senate have different sets of Standing Orders that guide their proceedings.  The Senate Standing Order No 1 provides that in all cases where matters are not expressly provided for in the Standing Orders, any procedural question shall be decided by the Speaker and that such decisions shall be based on the constitution and the laws.  Article 123 (4) of the constitution provides that each county delegation shall have one vote to be cast on behalf of the county by the head of the county delegation.  Contrary to the happenings in the Senate on the material day, there is no provision empowering the leader of majority or minority to vote for their colleagues.  However, the Article notes that in the absence of the head of the county delegation, another member of the delegation designated by the head of the delegation shall vote.  The constitution further states that the person who votes on behalf of a delegation shall determine whether or not to vote in support of, or against the matter after consulting the other members of the delegation.  While the Senate’s Standing Order 78 is a copy-paste of this Article (123), the voting in the Senate on the material may have violated the constitutional.  At the time, the House voted on the report of the mediation committee on the County Governments (Amendment) Bill by Mr Murkomen, which seeks to have governors appoint their deputies whenever a vacancy arises, was being voted for.  The Senators also voted to endorse the mediation report of the County Government (Amendment) Bill by Makueni Senator Mutula Kilonzo junior on the suspension of a county government.  They also voted to pass the Division of Revenue Bill 2020 but with amendments.  In the National Assembly that is also sitting during this Covid-19 crisis period Speaker Justin Muturi has played safe.  Speaker Muturi has designated the extension of the debating chamber to include the member’s lounge, lobbies, the cafeteria area and erected tents.  As such, MPs in these designated areas are accorded the requisite privileges to follow and contribute to debate in the chamber as well as vote now that it cannot hold the 349 MPs because of the social-distancing protocol.  Such privileges included using the parliamentary orderlies to escort members in the designated areas to the dispatch box of the debating chamber whenever they be selected by Speaker Muturi to contribute on debates and back after concluding their contributions.  Whenever a vote would be taken, Speaker Muturi appointed members of the Speaker’s panel- Patrick Mariru (Laikipia West) and Chris Omulele (Luanda) to move physically around collecting votes of the MPs outside the debating chamber but within the designated areas.  Leader of majority in the National Assembly Aden Duale hailed Mr Muturi noting that the decisions of parliament must always abide by the constitution.  “Ours was well planned with strict adherence to the House Rules, the law and the constitution. No one can challenge the constitutionality of the decisions the National Assembly has taken during this crisis period,” Mr Duale, who is also the Garissa Township MP, said.  “I want to urge my colleagues in the Senate not to use the crisis period to bend the law and the constitution to satisfy the interests of a few selfish individuals. By doing so, they will not be serving the interests of the counties but selfish interests,” he added.	News

"Aston Villa's James Chester waiting on contract decisions  Villa defender James Chester has revealed there is no ‘definitive stance’ over whether his deal with the club will be extended or not.   03 May 2020, 13:41   The 31-year-old defender – currently on loan at Stoke – is set to see his Villa contract expire on June 30.  That could be extended, though, in line with when the season ends – if football resumes following the coronavirus outbreak – and Chester insists that would be ‘fine’ by him.  “My deal ends on (June 30) but I haven’t discussed it as there is no definitive stance yet,” Chester told The Athletic.  “There is the chance contracts could be extended automatically to the end of the season, whatever the new date is, and that would be fine by me.  ""But I can see other situations where a player might not want to play on to avoid risking injury and jeopardising any move.”  Chester – blighted by injuries in recent years – thinks the pandemic could help him if he ends up a free agent, though.  “I think the crisis will change how the free agent market works,” he said.  “Five years ago, being 31 and out of contract would have been a wonderful position.  “But the dynamic of football seems to have altered in that time, where clubs prefer to spend money on younger players, hoping for them to improve and their value to rise. Now though, if clubs have tighter budgets, a free transfer might become popular again.  “I’m fortunate in that the money I’ve earned in my career gives me a buffer, whatever happens.”"	NotNews
"Industry super funds to demand answers as ME Bank borrowers fume  03 May 2020, 13:45 by Nick Toscano  Industry super fund shareholders of boutique lender Members Equity Bank will demand an urgent explanation on Monday following concerning claims of borrowers being cut off from personal funds without their consent or knowledge.  The Age and Sydney Morning Herald  reported on Saturday that Melbourne-based ME Bank, owned by 26 industry superannuation funds, had blindsided customers by removing their access to money in redraw facilities in order to pay down home loans.    ME Bank is facing mass complaints from customers. Luis Enrique Ascui   Bill Watson, chief executive of the $3 billion industry fund First Super, described the news as ""concerning"".  ""I'll be seeking an explanation from the bank tomorrow,"" he said on Sunday. ""Once we've received an explanation, we will determine what action needs to be taken from there. As a shareholder, clearly we don't want to see consumers disadvantaged.""  Gerard Noonan, the chairman of the $6 billion Media Super, said several members of the fund had raised questions about the ME Bank move.     ""We're looking into it,"" Mr Noonan said. ""So far it seems like a readjustment of the way the bank has structured its drawdown facilities when customers have used their excess mortgage repayments as a source of back-up source of borrowing.""  Home loan redraw facilities allow borrowers who are ahead on their loan repayments to withdraw funds above their minimum repayment amounts if they need to use those funds for any other purpose. On its website, ME Bank promotes its redraw facility as a product that allows customers to make extra mortgage repayments and with the added flexibility of letting clients ""redraw money from your loan at any time, for free.""  Other industry super fund directors said they had been seeking to speak with ME Bank over the weekend for information about what had occurred. ""But I haven't been able to talk to anyone,"" said one.  A number of customers last week contacted The Age and The Sydney Morning Herald after noticing between 10 and 50 per cent of their redraw funds were absorbed into their home loan without any notification.  In a statement released on Saturday ME Bank acknowledged the changes had caused concern among some customers, ""particularly in the current environment"". The lender said the changes were designed to prevent customers from overusing their redraw to a point where they risked falling behind on their original repayment schedule.  ""This can put customers at risk of not meeting their repayment commitments, potentially leaving them open to financial hardship at the end of the loan term,"" ME Bank said.  ""No money has been removed from customer accounts. The adjustment made is to the amount available for redraw.""  ME Bank said staff were contacting affected customers and reviewing their circumstances to determine how they could help with their financial needs."	NotNews
Cricket Australia gets $50 million loan as safety cover if India’s tour is cancelled: Report  The reported deal with Commonwealth Bank raised fresh questions about the governing body’s decision to stand down 80% of its staff due to financial crisis.  03 May 2020, 13:11 by Press Trust of India  Cricket Australia has secured a loan of $50 million, an upfront payment as part of a larger $200 million credit, which it has sought to cover the losses if India fail to tour the country later this year due to the coronavirus pandemic.  According to a report published in The Sydney Morning Herald , stakeholders have been informed that the loan with the Commonwealth Bank is a “done deal”.  However, it raised fresh questions about the governing body’s decision to stand down 80% of its staff last month due to financial crisis. CA stood down more than 200 staff on 20% pay until the end of June with chief executive Kevin Roberts fearing they might run out of money by August if the drastic cuts were not made.  The decision, which had saved CA about $3 million, is in question now with the governing body securing $50 million loan.  While Roberts, himself, is still earning 80% of his salary, he is set to propose to state associations a 25% reduction in grants from CA, the reports said.  CA is staring at losing a staggering 300 million Australian dollars in the wake of the pandemic and India’s four-Test tour in December-January could provide relief to the struggling body.  Former Test all-rounder Shane Watson, who is the president of Australian Cricketers’ Association Board, will convene a meeting early next week “to formalise a position on the state of the game’s finances”.

"Carole Baskin thought she was talking to Jimmy Fallon on Zoom. She was pranked.  03 May 2020, 22:14 by Rachel Kraus     Carole Baskin has been mostly quiet since the world became obsessed with Netflix's documentary series Tiger King . Now, the documentary subject has given the world a rare peek into her life in coronavirus quarantine, but she was tricked into doing so.  The Big Cat Rescue founder joined a Zoom call believing she was being interviewed by Jimmy Fallon to promote her animal sanctuary. Instead, she was talking to two YouTubers who had tricked her into thinking she was speaking with Fallon by posing as a casting company and playing sound bites of Fallon's voice. The YouTubers had clipped Fallon's soundbites from other videos. Fallon's continued to do The Tonight Show from home during quarantine, interviewing celebrities over video chat.  Josh Pieters and Archie Manners are the self-styled pranksters behind the fake Tonight Show interview. They've tricked other minor celebrities before by posing as talkshow bookers. But the Baskin interview is notable since she has been so private since Tiger King debuted.  Baskin, whose shown as the nemesis of Tiger King 's main subject, Joe Exotic, has criticized the show for her portrayal. The former zoo owner and tiger breeder is currently serving a prison term for hiring a hitman to kill Baskin. Baskin may run an animal sanctuary, but the documentary doesn't paint her as a saint. It airs concerns about her animal habitats and chronicles her ex-husband's disappearance in 1997. Local police never accused Baskin of wrongdoing, but her ex's family and friends suggest foul play (and that she fed him to her tigers). She denies it all.  Baskin tells the fake ""casting company"" she's doing the interview ""for the cats,"" and uses it to promote the Big Cat Public Safety Act , potential legislation intended to stop the breeding of big cats in captivity. She only agreed to the interview if Tiger King and the ensuing controversy wouldn't be mentioned. She said her daughter her convinced her to talk to Fallon.  No one was physically hurt by this prank, but it's likely a blow to Baskin's ego. It's tempting to look at pranking for clicks as harmless, if groan-worthy. However, a hunger for YouTube views has put people in harm's way as YouTubers have undertaken more and more risky and morally questionable ""pranks"" to make videos all in the name of virality.  Check out the video to see what Baskin and her cool cats and kittens have been up to in quarantine."	NotNews
As lockdowns ease, some countries report new infection peaks  03 May 2020, 22:53 by https://www.dawn.com/authors/156/ap, AP     While millions of people took advantage of easing coronavirus lockdowns to enjoy spring weather, some of the world’s most populous countries reported worrisome new peaks in infections on Sunday, including India, which saw its biggest single-day jump yet.  India, second in population only to China, reported more than 2,600 new infections.  Meanwhile, Indian air force helicopters showered flower petals on hospitals in several cities to thank doctors, nurses and police at the forefront of the battle against the pandemic.  The country’s number of confirmed cases neared 40,000 as the population of 1.3 billion marked the 40th day of a nationwide lockdown that has upended lives, cost millions of jobs and left millions hungry and desperate. The official death toll reached 1,323.  And in Russia, new coronavirus cases exceeded 10,000 for the first time.  Russia's latest tally of infections was nearly double the new cases reported a week ago. More than half of Russia’s new cases were in Moscow, where concern is rising about whether the capital’s medical facilities will be overwhelmed.  Russian epidemiologist Alexander Gintsburg told the Interfax news agency that the sharp increase in cases reflected increased testing, which has doubled over the past 10 days, and did not indicate a deepening pandemic.  In all, Russia has reported 1,222 virus deaths among 124,000 infections, numbers that health experts widely believe undercount the true toll of its outbreak.  The confirmed death toll in Britain climbed near that of Italy, the epicentre of Europe’s outbreak, even though the UK population is younger than Italy’s and Britain had more time to prepare before the pandemic hit.  The United States continues to see tens of thousands of new infections each day, with more than 1,400 new deaths reported on Saturday.  Health experts warn that a second wave of infections could hit unless testing is expanded dramatically after lockdowns are eased. But pressure to reopen economies keeps building after the weeks-long shutdown of businesses worldwide plunged the global economy into its deepest slump since the 1930s and wiped out millions of jobs.  China, which reported only two new cases, has seen a surge in visitors to newly reopened tourist spots after domestic travel restrictions were relaxed ahead of a five-day holiday that runs through Tuesday.  Nearly 1.7 million people visited Beijing parks on the first two days of the holiday, and Shanghai’s main tourist spots welcomed more than 1 million visitors, according to Chinese media. Many spots limited daily visitors to 30 per cent of capacity.  Meanwhile, Italians counted down the hours until Monday’s reopening of parks and public gardens.  With sunshine and warm temperatures across the country, many people went outdoors, walking down streets and chatting on sidewalks. Despite the easing, Italians will still have to stay a metre apart. Picnics are not allowed, and playgrounds will remain closed.  In a sign that the disease still has a firm grip in some places, Rome’s infectious diseases hospital admitted 28 confirmed Covid-19 patients from a nursing home.  In Spain, many ventured outside for the first time since the country’s lockdown began on March 14, but social distancing rules remained in place. Masks are mandatory starting on Monday on public transit.  “There is highly probability that we will see new outbreaks,” said Spanish health expert Fernando Simon. “That is what we must be prepared for and keep in mind over the following months.”  In Britain, Prime Minister Boris Johnson is under pressure to reveal how the country will lift the lockdown that began on March 23.  The restrictions are due to last through Thursday, but with hundreds of deaths still being reported daily — twice as many recently as Italy or Spain — it’s unclear how the country can safely loosen the restrictions.  The 55-year-old Johnson, who spent three nights in intensive care while being treated for Covid-19, told The Sun newspaper that he knew his doctors were preparing for the worst.  “It was a tough old moment, I won’t deny it,” he said.  They had a strategy to deal with a ‘death of Stalin’-type scenario if he succumbed to the virus.  Another potentially troubling sign emerged in Afghanistan’s capital city of Kabul, where a third of the 500 people selected in random test came up positive for the virus.  In the US, New Jersey reopened state parks, though several had to turn people away after reaching a 50pc limit in their parking lots. Margie Roebuck and her husband were among the first on the sand at Island Beach State Park.  “46 days in the house was enough,” she said.  Speaking on Fox News Sunday , White House coronavirus coordinator Dr Deborah Birx expressed concern about protests by armed and mostly mask-less crowds demanding an end to stay-at-home orders and a full reboot of the economy.  US President Donald Trump has encouraged people to “liberate” their states.  “It’s devastatingly worrisome to me personally, because if they go home and infect their grandmother or their grandfather, they will feel guilty for the rest of our lives,” she said. “So we need to protect each other at the same time we’re voicing our discontent.”  Meanwhile, the divide in the United States between those who want lockdowns to end and those who want to move more cautiously extended to Congress.  The Republican-majority Senate will reopen on Monday in Washington DC. The Democrat-controlled House of Representatives is staying shuttered.  US Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell’s decision to convene 100 senators gives President Trump, a Republican, the imagery he wants of America getting back to work, despite the risks.  Pope Francis called on Sunday for international collaboration in the search for a vaccine and treatment for Covid-19 and invited faithful of all religions to spiritually unite in prayer, fasting and works of charity on May 14.  The virus has infected 3.4 million people and killed more than 244,000 worldwide, including more than 66,000 dead in the United States, according to a count by Johns Hopkins University .  Europe has seen more than 139,00 confirmed virus deaths, with more than 28,000 each in Italy and Britain and around 25,000 each in France and Spain.  All the numbers are considered to be undercounts, due to testing issues, the problems of counting deaths in a pandemic and deliberate concealment by some governments.	News

Doubts over Joshua-Pulev fight   30 Apr 2020, 03:42   Our Reporter    A DATE for Anthony Joshua’s clash with Kubrat Pulev is no closer to being finalised amid the coronavirus crisis’ stranglehold on sport.

It was then pencilled in, but never confirmed, for July 25 when the pandemic ground sport across the world to a halt.  But with all sports set to return behind closed doors, Joshua faces an indefinite wait to defend the belts he won back from Andy Ruiz Jr last December.  The fight is unlikely to be held behind closed doors but could be moved to a smaller venue, depending on government advice.  Matchroom Boxing CEO Frank Smith told Mirror Fighting : “A lot of the big fights, Joshua vs Pulev, Dereck Chisora v Oleksandr Usyk and Dillian Whyte vs Alexander Povetkin, are very difficult to run financially without the gate.  Read Also: Joshua–Fury fight confirmed for 2021  “I’m hopeful he will fight this year, we’re looking at a number of different options. We’re talking to Tottenham still but that’s very tough with the football schedule and not knowing what will happen with crowds.  “We could look at smaller venues for him as time goes on; it’s difficult to make a decision now without knowledge of how things will look.”  Boxing is currently suspended in the UK until June with Matchroom’s next show currently scheduled for June 27 in Newcastle. But a July restart is more likely with TV studios and purpose-built venues set to host fights without crowds.	NotNews
The Covid nudge: Labour shortage makes Punjab, Haryana farmers switch from paddy to cotton  Paddy transplanting in the two states is done by over 10 lakh labourers, mostly seasonal migrants from Bihar and UP. There is uncertainty over their availability this time.  30 Apr 2020, 03:59 by Anju Agnihotri Chaba  COVID-19 has opened a window of opportunity to wean away farmers in Punjab and Haryana from growing rice to less water-guzzling crops such as cotton and maize.  The driver: Uncertainty over the availability of an estimated 1 million labourers from Uttar Pradesh and Bihar who undertake the bulk of the paddy transplanting that begins from mid-June. That, plus the lack of mechanical transplanting options, in contrast to the ubiquitous combines used for both paddy and wheat harvesting, means fewer farmers are likely to take up rice cultivation in the coming kharif season.     Manjit Singh Sidhu has, for over a decade, been farming paddy on his 13 acres at Uddat Bhagat Ram village in Punjab’s Mansa district. But this time he has decided to sow cotton on 11 acres, limit paddy to 2 acres, that too, subject to getting enough local labour. “I finished harvesting wheat on April 20, and I am waiting for water from the Kotla Branch of the Sirhind Canal (on the Sutlej River). They (government) normally release it around April 30, which will enable me to plant cotton,” says the 43-year-old.  Shamsher Singh, from the same village, also plans to only grow cotton on his 8-acre holding, which was entirely under paddy until the 2019 kharif season. Jagsir Singh from Jhumba village of Bathinda district is going for cotton on four of his nine acres, again previously fully planted to paddy.  “The people who transplant paddy are from Bihar and UP. Nobody knows if they will come. Even if the lockdown is lifted on May 3, train services are unlikely to resume soon and I cannot take a risk. While local labourers can be used, they will demand Rs 4,500-5,000 per acre, whereas the migrant workers charge only Rs 2,500,” he points out.    What are human challenge trials, and why are they controversial?    In homemade masks, two fabrics better than one    Govt's guidelines for home isolation of mild and pre-symptomatic Covid-19 patients     Click here for more   Southwest Punjab — mainly the districts of Mansa, Bathinda, Muktsar and Fazilka — was traditionally a cotton belt. Many farmers in recent times, however, switched to paddy, thanks to assured minimum support price-based procurement and free power supply for groundwater irrigation during the cropping season.  This was further supported by the availability of migrant labour for transplanting paddy seedlings, which are first raised in nursery beds for 25-30 days before being uprooted and replanted in the main field.  “It is a very labour-intensive operation. The plant population in paddy is about 33 per square metre, or 133,550 per acre. This is more than thrice the 40,000-odd plants per acre for cotton. Also, since paddy transplanting is in puddled (muddy standing water) conditions, there is both drudgery and difficultly in movement. A single labourer typically does around 10 acres from mid-June to mid-July,” explains A K Singh, director of the Indian Agricultural Research Institute (IARI) in New Delhi.  The roughly 43 lakh hectares (106 lakh acres) under paddy in Punjab and Haryana, translates into a requirement of 1 million-1.1 million labourers, an estimated 90 per cent-plus of them being seasonal migrants from UP and Bihar. With a question mark over their availability — they normally come by train in early June — transplanting could well be impacted.  While mechanical transplanting is possible in theory, it needs raising the seedlings in special mat nurseries or trays. “Farmers have gone in for mechanisation only in harvesting, where the combines are also manufactured indigenously and adapted to our conditions. The machines used in transplanting are largely imported and farmers haven’t felt the need for them when they could rely on migrant labourers. Necessity is the mother of invention,” adds Singh.  But labour shortage might this time prompt farmers to plant more area under cotton or maize. Crop diversification — weaning farmers away from paddy, with all its associated problems of groundwater depletion and pollution due to burning of the leftover stubble from harvesting by combines — is a strategy the Punjab and Haryana governments have for long tried to implement in vain.  It stands a chance now, at least in the old cotton belts of southwest Punjab and east Haryana (Sirsa, Fatehabad, Jind, Hisar and Bhiwani). In cotton, planting can be done by farmers themselves, employing family labour.  “We have set a target of 5.50 lakh hectares (lh) under cotton this kharif, against last year’s 3.92 lh. For maize, it is 3 lh, up from 1.6 lh. The overall paddy area should fall from 29.2 lh to 26.2. Within that, basmati acreage is to rise from 6.29 lh to 7 lh, while dropping from 22.91 lh to 19.21 lh for non-basmati varieties,” Sutantar Kumar Airy, director of Punjab’s agriculture department, told The Indian Express .  Basmati paddy consumes less water (it can be transplanted after June-end by when the monsoon sets in fully), is mostly manually harvested (entailing no burning of standing stubble) and is a source of foreign exchange ($ 4.71 billion exports in 2018-19). IARI’s Singh feels there is a strong case for arranging special trains to transport migrant labour for transplanting basmati over 18-19 lh: 7-8 lh in Haryana, 6-6.5 lh in Punjab, and 4-4.5 lh in West UP.  At Sukhchain village of Sirsa district’s Baragudha tehsil, Prithpal Singh Gill has already completed sowing cotton on 8 out of his 10 acres. “I harvested my wheat on April 13, sold it on April 25 and, in the mean time, started sowing cotton from April 22. On the remaining 2 acres, I will grow guar (cluster-bean), not paddy. Getting transplanting labour is going to be tough,” says the 26-year-old B.Sc in agriculture.  © The Indian Express (P) Ltd	News

"India needs Rs 65,000 crore to treat poor: Raghuram Rajan to Rahul Gandhi on COVID-19 crisis  30 Apr 2020, 05:01 by Alphonse Joseph     New Delhi, Apr 30: Congress leader Rahul Gandhi and former RBI Governor Raghuram Rajan interacted on Thursday, discussing many aspects of the coronavirus crisis that has plagued the world and has gripped the country.     Raghuram Rajan    During the interaction, Rahul Gandhi said that people's minds are full of questions around the ongoing coronavirus crisis and what is going to happen with the Indian economy.  The Congress leader also asked if there would be any strategic changes after the coronavirus pandemic that India could use to its advantage.  Reacting to this, the former RBI Governor said that incidents like the novel coronavirus pandemic rarely have any positive results for any country. However, he also said that the crisis would enable a ""rethinking of everything in the global economy"".  ""India can assume the leadership role in shaping that dialogue, to be a leader in that dialogue,"" Rajan said.  ""There will have to be a rethinking of everything in the global economy once we are out of this. If there is an opportunity for India, it is in shaping that dialogue and in being the leader in that dialogue. India is not one of the warring parties but a country big enough to have its voice heard in the global economy,"" Rajan told Gandhi.  The former RBI Governor also said that opting for a second or third lockdown to check the spread of coronavirus disease would be devastating for the country's economy.  ""Second or third lockdown will be devastating. It does diminish our credibility. We don't have to aim for 100 per cent success - it is not possible too - we have to manage the reopening,"" Dr Rajan stated.  He further said that India would need a budget of Rs 65,000 crore to help the poor."	News
US says remdesivir shows 'clear-cut' effect in treating coronavirus  30 Apr 2020, 05:25 by Reuters  WASHINGTON: Covid-19 patients on the antiviral remdesivir recovered more than 30 per cent faster than those on a placebo, the results of a major clinical trial showed Wednesday as a top US scientist hailed the drug’s “clear-cut” benefit.  It represents the first time any medication has been shown to improve outcomes against the Covid-19 illness, which has claimed more than 200,000 lives globally and brought the world economy to a grinding halt.  Anthony Fauci, who oversaw the investigation, told reporters at the White House: “The data shows that remdesivir has a clear-cut, significant, positive effect in diminishing the time to recovery.”  He added that the trial was proof “that a drug can block this virus,” and compared the finding to the arrival of the first antiretrovirals that worked against HIV in the 1980s, albeit with modest success at first.  A statement by the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases that Fauci heads said that patients on the drug had a 31 per cent faster time to recovery than those on a placebo.  “Specifically, the median time to recovery was 11 days for patients treated with remdesivir compared with 15 days for those who received placebo,” it said.  The results also suggested that people who were on the drug were less likely to die, although the difference was not huge: The mortality rate was 8.0 per cent for the group receiving remdesivir versus 11.6 per cent for the placebo group.  The trial began on February 21 and involved 1,063 people across 68 locations in the US, Europe and Asia.  The first patient to be enrolled was an American who was repatriated after being quarantined on the Diamond Princess cruise ship and was treated at the University of Nebraska Medical Center.  Neither the patients nor their physicians were aware of which group they belonged to, in order to eliminate unconscious bias.  Peter Horby, an epidemiologist at the University of Oxford who was not involved in the study, said: “We need to see the full results, but if confirmed this would be a fantastic result and great news for the fight against Covid-19.”     Scott Gottlieb, a former commissioner of the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), wrote on Twitter: “There’s now enough data to support consideration of access under an emergency use authorization.”  This would allow doctors to prescribe the drug outside of the context of clinical trials.   Blocks viral replication   Remdesivir, which previously failed in trials against Ebola, belongs to a class of drugs that act on the virus directly — as opposed to controlling the abnormal and often lethal autoimmune response it causes.  It mimics one of the four building blocks of RNA and DNA and gets absorbed into the virus’s genome, which in turn stops the pathogen from replicating.  In his remarks to the press, Fauci indicated that since this had yielded some success, it could pave the way for better drugs using the same approach.  There had been mixed news about the intravenous antiviral in recent weeks.  A summary of results posted on the website of the World Health Organization last week showed it failed in a smaller Chinese trial. The Lancet on Wednesday published the formal paper describing that experiment.  In this study of 237 patients in Wuhan, China, doctors found no positive effects of administering the drug compared with a control group of adults, except for those patients who required ventilators.  But the Chinese test had to be halted early because it could not recruit enough people to meet its initial goals, and was considered by many experts to be too small to draw reliable conclusions from.  Fauci said it was “not an adequate study.”  Apart from remdesivir, the antimalarial drugs hydroxychloroquine and chloroquine are also being widely used against Covid-19 on a so-called “compassionate basis” pending results from large trials.  Other therapies that are being studied include collecting antibodies from Covid-19 survivors and injecting them in patients, or harvesting antibodies from genetically-engineered mice that were deliberately infected.

This tool assigns a certain amount of “weight” to each indicator, and this “weight” can influence adjacents price levels. These weightings mean that one price level without any indicator or moving average but under the influence of two “strongly weighted” levels accumulate more resistance than their neighbors. In these cases, the tool signals resistance in apparently empty areas.   Learn more about Technical Confluence	News

USD/CHF Price Analysis: Sideways churn continues  30 Apr 2020, 02:55 by Omkar Godbole    USD/CHF trades in a narrow range for the fifth straight day.    A daily close above 0.98 would confirm a range breakout.    USD/CHF is trading near 0.9745 at press time, representing a 0.15% gain on the day.  While the pair is flashing green, it is still trapped in the recent trading range of 0.9710-0.98. As a result, immediate bias remains neutral.  A close above 0.98 would confirm range breakdown and open the doors for at least a 100-pip rally. Alternatively, a move through the lower end of the range would imply an end of the upward move from the March 30 low of 0.95 and would shift risk in favor of a drop 0.9592 (April 15 low).  The 14-day relative strength index is currently hovering in the bullish territory above 50. If the RSI is a guide, the pair could soon see a bullish breakout. Indicators, however, tend to follow price.  Also, the broader trend will turn bullish if and when the spot clears the resistance of the trendline falling from April 2019 and November 2019 highs. As of writing, that resistance is located at 0.9876.

"Abe to consider starting academic year in September   30 Apr 2020, 02:33   TOKYO — Prime Minister Shinzo Abe suggested Wednesday he will consider pushing back the start of the academic year to September from April as the coronavirus outbreak in Japan has forced schools to shut.  Abe said that since Japan is undergoing a change of such major magnitude, ""I would like to consider various options,"" referring to a September start of the academic year.  Speaking at a House of Representatives session, he also acknowledged the change would greatly affect not just children and their parents but society as a whole.  Japan's academic year starts in April, while a September start is common in many other countries. Many schools across Japan closed after the government requested them to do so on Feb. 27 and they are expected to remain closed through May 6, the end of the state of emergency, or even longer.  Education minister Koichi Hagiuda backed up line Abe's view regarding the September start, saying it would be an option if it gains wide public support.  Hagiuda also indicated that prefectural and local governments should jointly take responsibility if they were to introduce a new academic year system.  Tokyo Gov Yuriko Koike on Tuesday expressed support for the September start of an academic year, saying ""following international standards is a part of education.""  ""If the new semester starts in September, kindergarten, elementary schools, junior and senior high schools and job hunting will change,"" she said. ""It will be a chance to change society greatly.""  As the country continues to see a growing number of people infected with the pneumonia-causing virus, Abe on Wednesday did not rule out amending the special measures law against the novel coronavirus.  ""We have to think of new responses if the (outbreak) cannot be contained under the current measures and legislation,"" he told the lower house Budget Committee.  The prime minister said social distancing had played a role but the reduction in person-to-person contact has not reached 80 percent as the government has requested.  © KYODO"	News
REPORT: NFL Might Play On Saturdays If College Football Season Is Delayed, Canceled  30 Apr 2020, 20:12 by Darrelle Lincoln  NFL commissioner Roger Goodell has already stated his willingness to make sure the season is played as scheduled but nothing can be determined as the coronavirus continues to run through the United States.  The NCAA college football season has not been determined yet, but if it is delayed in anyway, the NFL is ready to pounce.  Andrew Marchand of the New York Post reported that the league is seriously considering playing games on Saturday if the college football season doesn’t start on time or is canceled as a whole.  “The NFL has had preliminary discussions with its broadcast partners about the idea. An NFL spokesman declined comment. While the majority of the week’s schedule would remain on Sundays, along with the primetime Monday and Thursday slates, some stand-alone games could be reset for Saturdays. The NFL will only consider the move if there is no college football. It is still unclear if college football will be played this fall because of the COVID-19 pandemic.”  Even if the college football season is delayed or canceled, it would hardly be the first time the NFL plays games on Saturdays. Doing it for an entire season would take it to an entirely new level.	News
"President Trump Reveals New Plans for Protecting America's Seniors  30 Apr 2020, 20:27 by Cortney O'Brien  President Trump hosted an event at the White House on Thursday to reveal the steps his administration is taking to protect older Americans, the group most vulnerable to the coronavirus that has now taken over 62,000 American lives. In particular, he announced ""vital new actions"" to protect seniors in nursing homes.  White House Counselor Kellyanne Conway previewed it as ""an exciting event as well about all we are doing for our elderly.”  Lawmakers like Tennessee Gov. Bill Lee and representatives from the National Guard are also provided comments on how they are working to protect seniors and nursing homes.  In his remarks, Trump made a few major announcements. FEMA, he said, will send supplemental shipments to all 15,400 Medicare and Medicaid certified nursing homes. Trump is also finalizing a new rule to mandate that coronavirus cases at nursing homes be reported directly to CDC, and the data will be posted online. Those facilities must also inform residents and family members of any cases or outbreaks.  Trump then announced the creation of the Coronavirus Commission for Safety and Quality in Nursing Homes, which will begin to convene in May. The commission will identify the best practices and provide recommendations for how to protection nursing home residents, Administrator for the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services Seema Verna explained.  The month of May, Trump added, will officially be declared Older Americans Month.  Watch the ""Protecting America's Seniors"" event below.      Editor's Note: This post has been updated."	News
"US: Armed protesters demand end to Michigan coronavirus lockdown  Dozens of protesters, some with rifles slung around their chests, enter the Capitol and demand to be heard.   30 Apr 2020, 20:21   Hundreds of angry protesters, some carrying firearms, gathered at Michigan’s State Capitol in Lansing on Thursday to protest against Governor Gretchen Whitmer’s request to extend the state of emergency to combat the coronavirus pandemic.  The protests came as state legislators debated a measure refusing the governor's request and voted to authorise a lawsuit challenging her authority and actions to combat the pandemic.  More:     US doctors go online to reveal 'bold, loud' coronavirus truths      What and who is behind the US anti-lockdown protests?      US medical workers stand up to anti-lockdown protesters     At one point during the legislative deliberations, dozens of protesters - many without face coverings and some with rifles slung around their chests - entered the Capitol and demanded to be let into the House chamber, which was closed to the public to allow room for representatives and reporters to spread apart. The crowd shouted, ""Let us in"" while mask-wearing sergeants and state police blocked them.  Demonstrators were allowed in the state Senate, which has fewer members and remained in session to also authorise legal action.  Firearms have been legally allowed in the Michigan state Capitol building for some time.     The protest appeared to be the largest in the state since April 15, when supporters and allies of President Donald Trump organised thousands of people for ""Operation Gridlock"", jamming the streets of Lansing with their cars to call out what they said was the overreach of Whitmer’s strict stay-at-home order.  It was one of the country’s first major anti-lockdown rallies and helped sparked a wave of similar events nationwide.  The slow reopening of state economies around the country has taken on political overtones, as Republican politicians and individuals affiliated with Trump’s re-election promoted protests in electoral battleground states such as Michigan.  ""Governor Whitmer, and our state legislature, it’s over with. Open this state,"" Mike Detmer, a Republican candidate for US Congress told the crowd. ""Let’s get businesses back open again. Let’s make sure there are jobs to go back to.""     Other speakers at the ""American Patriot Rally,"" which had different organisers to the mid-April protest, questioned the deadliness of COVID-19, the disease caused by the coronavirus. They also said Whitmer’s stay-at-home order violated constitutional rights, and urged people to open their businesses on May 1 in disregard of her order.  Protesters, many from more rural parts of Michigan, have argued it has crippled the economy statewide even though the majority of deaths from the virus are centred on the southeastern Detroit metro area.     Whitmer's stay-at-home order, the strictest in the US, is in effect through May 15. House Republicans wanted changes, such as allowing elective medical and dental procedures again and certainty on the date she plans to reopen the economy on a regional basis. Meanwhile, the governor has allowed some businesses, such as lawn-care companies and greenhouses, to resume operating.  Many states, including Georgia, Oklahoma, Alaska, South Carolina and Ohio, have already moved to restart parts of their economies following weeks of mandatory lockdowns that have thrown nearly one in six American workers out of their jobs.

Trump Claims There’s ‘Tremendous Pent-Up Demand’ That’ll Boost Economy Because ‘I Feel It’   30 Apr 2020, 18:00   Though tens of millions of Americans are getting laid off thanks to COVID-19, President Donald Trump claimed on Thursday that there is “tremendous pent-up demand” that will lead to a “spectacular” economy next year because that’s what he feels.  “I’ll tell you what: I feel it,” Trump told New Jersey Gov.

"Rainbow Six Siege reverses Ying Candela buff following backlash  Rainbow Six Siege rolls back changes to Ying's Candela count one week after the Y5S2.1 update.  30 Apr 2020, 18:11 by Matt Brown   Source: Ubisoft   What you need to know   Ubisoft has rolled out an unscheduled patch for Tom Clancy's Rainbow Six Siege.

FBI Director Christopher Wray says tech companies should let law enforcement decrypt messages — but he argued the exact opposite in court in 2015, new filings show, Business Insider - Business Insider Singapore  30 Apr 2020, 18:40 by Aaron Holmes, Business Insider US   As FBI director, Christopher Wray has called on tech companies to make it easier for law enforcement to crack into encrypted messages.  The FBI has spent nearly a decade trying to get Facebook and Apple, which use end-to-end encryption, to build “back doors” that would let law enforcement with a warrant decrypt users’ messages. The companies have refused.  But before he joined the FBI, Wray’s law firm defended WhatsApp against a 2015 lawsuit brought by the Justice Department. Wray argued in favor of strong end-to-end encryption at the time.  Details of the sealed 2015 lawsuit surfaced Wednesday as part of an ongoing legal battle between WhatsApp and Israeli spyware firm NSO Group.  Visit Business Insider’s homepage for more stories .   For nearly a decade, the federal government has been trying to make tech companies like Apple and Facebook build “back doors” into their messaging apps that would let law enforcement access people’s encrypted messages.  FBI Director Christopher Wray has been a vocal critic of end-to-end encryption in recent years, testifying before the House of Representatives in February that end-to-end encryption in messaging apps like iMessage, WhatsApp, and Facebook Messenger is a “dream come true for predators and child pornographers.”  But new court filings show that in 2015, before he joined the FBI, Wray’s private law firm defended WhatsApp against a Justice Department lawsuit that aimed to weaken the messaging app’s encryption. Wray argued in favor of strong end-to-end encryption at the time.  The new filings became public Wednesday night as part of an ongoing legal battle between Facebook-owned WhatsApp and Israeli spyware firm NSO Group . The law firm Wray previously worked for, King & Spalding, represents NSO Group in the current lawsuit, and Facebook is arguing that the firm has a conflict of interest because it defended WhatsApp in the 2015 suit.  An FBI spokesperson said in a statement to Business Insider that Wray “cannot comment on the scope of his prior representation of WhatsApp.”  “When he was an attorney in private practice, however, the Director represented his clients’ interests and advocated on their behalf, as a result of which he earned a reputation as a highly skilled and sought-after legal professional. Like all other lawyers, his duty of loyalty was to his client, and he did not put his personal views ahead of his clients’ interests or allow them to affect the legal work he did for clients. Today, as director of the FBI, his duty is to act in the best interests of the American people,” the FBI spokesperson said.  Tech companies have resisted the federal government’s pressure to weaken encryption on messaging apps. Apple and Facebook have both argued that users’ privacy is at stake, and that building “back doors” would also make it easier for hackers to break into people’s messages.	NotNews
Brookhouse ordered to halve school fees  30 Apr 2020, 18:29 by SAM KIPLAGAT  In Summary   Justice Weldon Korir also stopped online classes for kindergarten and lower primary learners pending the determination of the petition.  Justice Korir directed the school’s board to file its response by May 5, for the hearing on May 13.   The High Court has ordered Brookhouse School to reduce fees by half following a petition by parents  Justice Weldon Korir also stopped online classes for kindergarten and lower primary learners pending the determination of the petition.  The parents moved to court on Wednesday, accusing the management of reducing the fees by a paltry 10 per cent, yet the schools are closed because of Covid-19.  Justice Korir directed the school’s board to file its response by May 5, for the hearing on May 13.  In court documents, the parents using the initials BPA, termed the school’s “paltry” discount as unlawful.  They also asked the court not to disclose their names to protect the rights of their children.  Through lawyer Ahmednasir Abdullahi, they are demanding a discount of at least 30 per cent as well as rebates for meals, transport and extra-curricular activities.   OTHER ARGUMENTS   In their push for higher discounts, the parents reckon that overheads have reduced and that some costs of managing the email-based or online classes have been transferred to them.  They argue that they now have to feed their children at home and pay internet costs for the online classes, among others.  They say they have to print teaching materials, teach the students and supervise the online learning, scan the home work and send to the individual teachers, buy learning and teaching materials and pay for internet services.  “A conservatory order be issued staying the implementation of payment of full fees … and in lieu they be allowed to offset up to 30 per cent of school fees pro forma,” a petition filed by Mr Abdullahi reads.  The parents say the school erred by failing to consult them, denying them information they needed to make decisions on their children’s learning.	News
One opponent would convince ex-heavyweight champ Junior dos Santos to fight at 205  30 Apr 2020, 18:00 by Guilherme Cruz, https://facebook.com/guicruzmma/  Junior dos Santos ’ shape has people wondering how “Cigano” will look in his next UFC bout.  After a ketogenic diet slimmed the former heavyweight champion, he’s not opposed to the idea of changing weight classes.  What started the whole process was quarantine. Like many people around the world, Dos Santos noticed the number on the scale ticking up as the weeks passed. Unable to train at American Top Team, he was seven pounds heavier than usual. So he reached out to his doctor Marcia Bogea and nutritionist Marcelo Guedes for advice, and they recommended 15 days of the low-carb, high-fat diet.  Twelve days into the regimen, Dos Santos clocked in a 245.8 pounds. He went on social media to share the results, and suddenly, people were wondering if the UFC had a new light heavyweight on its hands.  The ex-champ’s original plan was to go down to 238 pounds, lighter than his weight when he knocked out Cain Velasquez to become the UFC heavyweight king in 2011.  “(Thursday) is the last day, but I asked them if we can continue doing it because I’m feeling very good,” dos Santos told MMA Fighting. “I would normally be around 247 since I wasn’t training harder, but I was getting heavier.”  Dos Santos doesn’t have a fight booked at the moment and said he’s currently not in negotiations with the UFC. “Cigano” hasn’t entered the octagon since Jan. 25, when he lost to Curtis Blaydes via second-round knockout.  “My goal is to stay light so I can get back to training right away, when I have a fight booked,” he said. “If I can stay around 238 and 242, that’s important for me, because I move a lot. I’ll benefit from my speed, one of my main characteristics. I will be faster.”  In fact, Dos Santos’ immediate success in the first weight-loss diet of his professional career could lead to a potential drop to light heavyweight. He said “nothing is impossible in our lives,” but added making 205 pounds “would be really, really, really hard to happen.”  And yet, for the Brazilian star, “this experience I’m living now is also a kind of test.”  “My main curiosity of one day making 205 is not about how I would feel at that weight, but to be able to face the man that is the greatest of the moment, Jon Jones ,” he said. “Who wouldn’t like to fight Jon Jones one day? I’m no different. One of the goals before I end my career would be to fight Jon Jones. But that’s part of the plans, our wishes, my dreams, so let’s see how things play out.”  In the end, all it would take for the UFC to convince Dos Santos to cut almost 40 pounds is to say a few magical words: Jon Jones has cleaned the division, and we will give you a shot at the light heavyweight title.  “I would sit down with my doctors, make a plan, a strategy,” Dos Santos said. “I would obviously need a bit more time to make weight well, but we would make that happen.”	NotNews

Jeff Hardy also mentioned to Corey Graves that he is aiming to win either the Universal Championship or WWE Championship before his WWE career comes to an end.

COVID-19: Relaxation of lockdown in Lagos, risky – legal practitioners   30 Apr 2020, 11:30   Agency Reporter    Two Lagos-base lawyers, Isaiah Odje and Adebayo Johnson, say the partial easing of lockdown in Lagos, against the spread of novel coronavirus at this time, “is not safe for residents”.  The lawyers spoke to the News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) in separate interviews on Thursday in Lagos.  NAN reports that President Muhammadu Buhari had on Monday announced the relaxation of the lockdown in Lagos, Ogun and Federal Capital Territory (FCT) from May 4, after four weeks of movement restriction.  Mr Odje of the Odje Chambers said that easing the lockdown in Lagos, at this time, was not the best decision.  “It is risky and may result in more casualties.  “With the way people will rush out from Monday for work and other engagements, I fear the number of confirmed COVID-19 cases will double in few days.  “Although Lagos State Government has announced that its workers from levels one to 12 should work from home, what of federal and private workers and other individuals?’’ Odje said.  According to him, there are people who have this virus unknowingly because it is yet to show any symptoms.  “By the time we mingle with them inside buses, in offices and other places, the virus will keep spreading.’’  He observed that many Lagos residents have not been complying fully with the stay-at-home order in the last four weeks and that was why the cases kept increasing.  “People move around on the street without observing social distancing; some even play football.  “The restriction order is only obeyed on major highways.  “Though many people are broke, but being broke is better than being infected with a deadly virus; prevention is better than cure.  “This is the time for people to take their safety into their own hands, observe precautionary measures, COVID-19 is real,’’ Odje told NAN.  Another lawyer, Mr Johnson, said that the relaxation of the lockdown was dangerous as Lagos would record more confirmed cases and even deaths because of its population.  “It is not safe to ease lockdown at this point in time because Lagos is over-crowded.  “We are at home for over four weeks and cases are increasing, it may get worse when the lockdown is lifted on Monday,’’ Johnson told NAN.  He urged Lagos residents to fully comply with the directives of the Federal and State Government.  “For the sake of the health of the nation, let us obey the instructions of the governments.  “Although it may not be easy, we must understand that there is time for everything and now is the time.  “This is a time of trials and sacrifice and we must learn to give government support to overcome this situation.  “Let ask God for the restoration of our lives, health and economy.’’ (NAN)	News

"Grassley demands Barr 'intervene' in Flynn case, says there should be 'consequences' for FBI, DOJ misconduct  30 Apr 2020, 17:23 by Brooke Singman  Sen. Chuck Grassley went on a rare Twitter tirade on Thursday, blasting the Justice Department and the FBI for their handling of the false statements case against former White House national security adviser Michael Flynn and urging Attorney General Barr to intervene.  Grassley, R-Iowa, served as Senate Judiciary Committee chairman at the onset of the Russia investigation. His tweets come after the Justice Department unsealed new FBI files a day earlier showing agents discussing their motivations for even interviewing Flynn in the first place -- including whether they should try ""to get him to lie, so we can prosecute him or get him fired.""  Grassley on Thursday said there should be ""consequences"" for misconduct, as critics have accused the FBI of entrapment.    NOW-IMPERILED CASE AGAINST FLYNN COST HIM MILLIONS OF DOLLARS, HIS HOUSE, HIS JOB    “New DOJ docs seem 2back Lt Gen Flynns claim that FBI/DOJ/Mueller team railroaded 30yr veteran in Russia probe For yrs, Ive asked for DOJs Flynn records Their response: ‘nothing 2see here,'"" Grassley tweeted, in his trademark Twitter style. “Obviously not true! Time to put all cards on the table Transparency brings accountability.”     In 2017, Flynn pleaded guilty to making false statements to the FBI about his conversations with then-Russian ambassador Sergey Kislyak. But he has yet to be sentenced, as his team has since raised issues over the FBI’s tactics in his case.  In his tweets Thursday, Grassley went on to say that the “FBI/DOJ screwed up so many times” in the Russia probe, and said it would be “very reasonable” for the attorney general and an “impartial judge 2take close look at Flynn case.”  “Accused deserves fairness+Public deserves accountability+ Prosecutor/investigator/lawyer misconduct deserves consequences,” Grassley tweeted.     “Many of my colleagues r rightfully calling for prosecution of ppl who violated Flynn’s constitutional rights MORE IMPORTANTLY the whole country needs to know how his rights were violated,” he continued. “TRUTH getting out is most important so this FBI abuse won’t be repeated again on someone else.”     Grassley went on to urge Barr to intervene, saying “it’s so obvious the constitutional punishment that GenFlynn has had for four long years u need to intervene and #FREE FLYNN.”     The documents, unsealed late Wednesday, revealed that top FBI officials openly questioned if their “goal” was “to get him to lie, so we can prosecute him or get him fired.”  The handwritten notes -- written by the FBI’s former head of counterintelligence Bill Priestap after a meeting with then-FBI Director James Comey and then-FBI Deputy Director Andrew McCabe, Fox News is told -- further suggested that agents planned in the alternative to get Flynn “to admit to breaking the Logan Act” when he spoke to Kislyak during the presidential transition period.  The Logan Act is an obscure statute that has never been used in a criminal prosecution; enacted in 1799 in an era before telephones, it was intended to prevent individuals from falsely claiming to represent the United States government abroad.  ""What is our goal?"" one of the notes read. ""Truth/Admission or to get him to lie, so we can prosecute him or get him fired?”  ""If we get him to admit to breaking the Logan Act, give facts to DOJ + have them decide,"" another note read. Constitutional law professor Jonathan Turley of George Washington University called the document's implications “chilling.”      VIDEO President Trump: Dirty cops at top of FBI tormented General Flynn   The memo appears to weigh the pros and cons of pursuing those different paths.  ""I don't see how getting someone to admit their wrongdoing is going easy on him,"" one note reads. Flynn did not ultimately admit to wrongdoing in the interview.    TRUMP BLASTS 'SCAM' AGAINST FLYNN AS FBI FILES RAISE QUESTIONS ABOUT FUTURE OF CASE    The document indicates that the agents at least discussed the merits of a by-the-book approach: ""If we’re seen as playing games, WH [White House] will be furious.”  Grassley went on to point out that the unsealed documents were “stamped with SCO as in Special Counsel’s Office.”  “Did Mueller have these docs?” he asked Thursday. “Why did his team sit on them? What else is Mueller team that cost taxpayers $30+ million hiding?”  He added: “The ppl deserve answers 2restore faith in federal law enforcement agencies.”     The Justice Department turned over the documents Wednesday, even though a February 2018 standing order in the case from the United States District Court for the District of Columbia required the government to turn over any exculpatory materials in its possession that pertained to Flynn. Such materials ordinarily do not need to be disclosed to uncharged individuals or those who have already pleaded guilty,  U.S. District Judge Emmet Sullivan has ruled .  Prosecutors last year rejected claims they were hiding evidence , saying ""the government has exceeded its discovery and disclosure obligations in this matter,"" including by providing Flynn with thousands of pages of documents.  Federal prosecutors at the time called the defense's filings a “fishing expedition.”  Flynn, who pleaded guilty to making false statements about his communications with Kislyak, previously said that FBI officials pressed him not to have the White House counsel present during questioning with two agents that led to his guilty plea. Flynn was not charged with any violation of the Logan Act.    MICHAEL FLYNN PROSECUTION: A TIMELINE OF TRUMP'S EX-NATIONAL SECURITY ADVISER'S CASE    Earlier this year, Flynn moved to withdraw his guilty plea for making false statements to the FBI. His legal team, at the time, said that the move was “because of the government’s bad faith, vindictiveness and breach of the plea agreement.”  The Department of Justice, in February, also tapped U.S. Attorney for the Eastern District of Missouri Jeff Jensen to review the case. The timeline of that investigation is unclear at this point.  President Trump last month floated a “full pardon” for Flynn.  “What happened to General Michael Flynn , a war hero, should never be allowed to happen to a citizen of the United States again!” the president tweeted Thursday morning.   Fox News' Mike Emanuel and Gregg Re contributed to this report."	News
"MIKE Revisits Simpler Times With Friends for ""Fortune Teller"" Music Video  Hinting at more new music coming soon.  30 Apr 2020, 17:34 by Patrick Johnson  Brooklyn rapper and sLums member MIKE has been sporadically releasing music over the past year, debuting work that’s been as solid as ever like his “NUMBERED DAYZ” Adult Swim single and collaboration with UK rapper Jadesea titled “Regrets.” His knack for dropping gems of wisdom and being at the center of his ever-talented group of friends has never been more apparent than with his latest “Fortune Teller” music video.  Don’t worry, this visual was shot in New York City during September 2019, just months after MIKE released his critically-acclaimed Tears of Joy full-length. In it, MIKE taps in with friend Medhane , acts as the hype-man for his YOUNG WORLD showcase and more. The track was produced by DJ Blackpower . There’s even a nice callback to the Brotherhood of the Traveling Boston Hat from that infamous Earl Sweatshirt “EAST” video . In the video’s description, the rapper hints at new music, writing, “new slaps ??? soon?”  Watch the full visual above. With the current climate, it’s better than ever to tap into new rap movements and discover artists who may go overlooked due to independently dropping projects, so we’ll leave a list of some of MIKE’s contemporaries to listen to during the times of social distancing.

Coronavirus | Activists seek testing of Ganga water for COVID-19 treatment  Mission under Jal Shakti Ministry sends the pitch to ICMR  30 Apr 2020, 17:32 by Jacob Koshy  The National Mission for Clean Ganga (NMCG), an arm of the Jal Shakti Ministry that deals with the Ganga clean-up plan , has forwarded to the Indian Council for Medical Research (ICMR) a proposal to undertake clinical trials and examine if Ganga water can be used to treat coronavirus ( COVID-19 ) patients.   Coronavirus lockdown | No improvement in Ganga water quality   The proposal was made by a collective of activists involved in the clean-up of the river as well as in the litany of litigation surrounding it.  The thrust of the proposal is that research for over a century – and most recently an investigation by the CSIR-National Environmental Engineering and Research Institute, Nagpur – had found that the upper stretches of the Ganga had several species of bacteriophages. Phages, as they are also called, are viruses that specifically target bacteria and are also extremely strain-specific. While there is research to suggest that these phages may have anti-microbial properties and could potentially destroy bacteria such as Mycobacterium streptococcus and Pseudomonas Yersinia , it is unclear how phages — being viruses themselves — could have anti-viral properties.   State-wise tracker for COVID-19 cases, deaths and testing, and a map of confirmed cases in India   COVID-19 is caused by SARS-CoV-2 virus infection. “There’s no evidence that viruses can, even in principle, be used to destroy other viruses. Phage therapy has its uses in experimental medicine and has been used to treat infections from antibiotic-resistant bacteria,” Sunit Singh, virologist, Benares Hindu University, told The Hindu .  ‘Experimental medicine’  The proponents of the proposal — Anil Gautam, A.K. Gupta, Bharat Jhunjunwala and Narendra Mehrotra — said the Ganga “could have” anti-viral properties, but the scale of the pandemic and the need for new drugs and treatment mean that there could be “immense benefit” from undertaking such studies on the lines of “experimental medicine.”   Centre to monitor lockdown impact on Ganga, Yamuna pollution   Before being forwarded to the ICMR, the letter reveals, the NMCG discussed the feasibility of the proposal with NEERI, on April 24. NEERI, which is a Council of Scientific and Industrial Research organisation, has an ongoing study examining whether the phages in the Ganga water are responsible for destroying pathogens and delaying putrefaction.  “The considered opinion of CSIR-NEERI is that overall, clinical trial on water alone may not yield very useful results, though this would need the considered opinion of agencies such as ICMR,” notes the NMCG letter, signed by D.P. Mathuria, Executive Director, NMCG, and addressed to the Director General, ICMR. “...It is true Ganga water has special properties which is prominent in upper stretches. Since no virus related studies have been yet carried out, one could attempt a pilot in the Upper Regions of Ganga.”  Most studies have been done in the context of years-long movement that sees Ganga water as “unique,” particularly the water in the upper stretches of Rudraprayag and before Tehri.  Because the flow of the water is largely unimpeded, and helped by a distinct microbiome, the river remains healthy. However, dams begin to interfere with the flow, accelerate unsustainable sedimentation and, once it reaches downstream Uttar Pradesh, is choked by the industrial and municipal sewage emanating from towns and factories along the river in other downstream States.

The Couch Gallery Crawl  30 Apr 2020, 17:30 by Thomas Benfield   Each week, we’re gathering the art world’s latest and best virtual museum and gallery offerings. Here, how to look at art from the safety of home.   1. David Zwirner has opened a new online viewing room for Marcel Dzama’s “Pink Moon ,” a collection of watercolor, ink, and graphite works on paper. Similar to Henry Darger’s posthumously legendary freedom-fighter trans children , the work’s convention takes true-to-life observation and mixes in elements of fantasy into the compositions. Very unlike the reclusive Darger, Dzama’s inspiration is drawn from early 2020 family trips to Mexico and Morocco. See  Like eating a ripe banana, 2020 , which balances this surreal atmosphere by depicting three girls’ ambivalence about a visit from a monkey. Oh, also, there’s a coloring book free to download to give the kids something to do while you’re on Zoom calls.  2. Hirshhorn Museum has been working fastidiously to document our current moment. The expression of this aggregation takes the form of a video diary by artists. Theaster Gates , Shirin Neshat , Christine Sun Kim , Tony Oursler , and others speak to the camera across the museum’s social-media channels and website. The remarkable result of this archival project is the opportunity it gives us to experience the forest and the trees collectively yet still in isolation.  3. See what William Monk has been painting as part of Pace Gallery ’s series of online exhibitions . Monk’s viewing room will open on May 5 with five new works featuring his trademark distortions, vibrant figurations, archival material, and text.  4. Inspired by, and drawing its name from, Donna Haraway’s proposal of intimacy without proximity, A.I.R. Gallery has created a space for collective contribution called Staying With the Trouble: Prompts for Practice . Every other evening, 2016–2017 A.I.R. fellow Alison Owen posts a phrase meant to be taken as a jumping-off point — a prompt to create something along with a community of artists. The next day, share your work with the tags #stayingwiththetrouble and #AIRpromptsforpractice2020 — A.I.R. will post its favorites on its Instagram . At the end of this project, Owen will catalogue and archive her favorites as well.  5. Sotheby’s has launched an online-only buy-now gallery network . The service provides digital viewing rooms of works for sale with publicly listed prices — no inquiries for prices or bidding wars involved (at least for works under $150,000; after that mark, the coded buying rituals of the upper echelons reclaim the space). In and among the first round of galleries to sign up includes Nick Cave’s  Soundsuit, 2012 , at Jack Shainman Gallery ; a sampling of Warhols from Kasmin Gallery ; and Tom Friedman’s very relevant  Hazmat Love, 2017 , from Luhring Augustine .  6. D.C.’s National Museum of Women in the Arts has created a new portal, NMWA @ Home . Check out its curated exhibitions, collections, artist profiles, talks, and a podcast. If you’re a Frida lover, they have an excellent exhibition of letters between Frida Kahlo and her mother — perfect to get you thinking about Mother’s Day while there’s still time to root around your apartment for something to regift.  7. The New Museum has posted a new virtual tour of its exhibition “Peter Saul: Crime and Punishment ” on YouTube . You can feel kind of like a celebrity getting a private viewing, as your tour is narrated by curator Gary Carrion-Murayari and the artist himself. Saul’s “warped surreal” Pop Art was created singularly as he reflected on American pop culture through Life and Mad magazines while living in Europe, largely unaware of early New York and London Pop Art movements. From that isolation came a new brand of hand-painted pop, and he has rightfully been placed among the pioneers of the 1950s and ’60s.  8. Skarstedt Gallery just launched a viewing room for a single work made during quarantine from Eric Fischl, titled American Hula . The work depicts a single gigantic nude figure. She has her back turned to us and dwarfs the trees as she passes, awkwardly gyrating into an abstract blue distance, swinging a Hula-Hoop around her hips. The work plays on contradictory dichotomies. Just as The Colossus ( ca. 1808–1812) of the Museo del Prado depicts a giant towering above clouds to symbolize an oncoming Napoleonic invasion, Fischl’s giant also conjures the sociopolitical. Tension between the often feminized landscape — the mother country — and the destructive size of this forced perspective, as well as the playful Hula-Hooping, dismantle any notion of violence and invite instead a coming, somewhat graceful, unstoppable change.

South African mourns anti-Apartheid stalwart Denis Goldberg   30 Apr 2020, 10:45    He was a co-defendant of Nelson Mandela but was kept in a separate prison under racial segregation rules.     Robben Island Prison, Cape Town, South Africa where many anti-Apartheid figures including Nelson Mandela were incarcerated (Gareth Copley/PA)   South African anti-Apartheid activist Denis Goldberg has died at his home near Cape Town, aged 87.  Mr Goldberg was a prominent member of the now-ruling African National Congress and stood trial alongside Nelson Mandela.  He spent 22 years in prison for his involvement with the ANC’s fight against Apartheid, the racist system of oppression imposed by the white minority government.  When his fellow accused were sent to Robben Island, as a white prisoner Mr Goldberg was separated from them and imprisoned in the capital, Pretoria.     Mr Goldberg’s niece, Joy Noero, said the liberation stalwart died peacefully Wednesday after having lung cancer and diabetes.  Mr Goldberg had continued his activism in post-apartheid South Africa and was a critic of former president Jacob Zuma, who stepped down in 2018 and faces multiple allegations of corruption.  Mr Goldberg was a critic of the ANC’s performance in government and the socio-economic conditions of the largely black poor majority in South Africa, one of the world’s most unequal countries.  Tributes poured in Thursday for Mr Goldberg, with many acknowledging the role he played in the fight against Apartheid.    Nelson Mandela (Johnny Green/PA)   “His commitment to ethical leadership was unflinching and even during his advanced age he formed part of the movement of veterans of the struggle calling for reassertion of moral center of society,” President Cyril Ramaphosa said.  “We will hold him in our thoughts and prayers as we say farewell at a time when we are not allowed to gather in numbers to say our goodbyes.”  “He was a member of a generation of leadership which shaped the country’s history in profound ways,” said Nelson Mandela Foundation chief executive Sello Hatang.  The ANC also paid tribute to Goldberg, saying “his was a life well-lived in the struggle for freedom in SA.  “We will miss him.”	NotNews
UK's first transgender parents call beautiful baby girl 'a dream come true!'  30 Apr 2020, 10:25 by Tilly Pearce     Britain’s first ever transgender parents have debuted their beautiful baby girl Millie on Good Morning Britain .  Hannah and Jake Graf welcomed their baby girl just a few days ago via surrogate, after Jake froze his eggs before transitioning.  Talking to Lorraine Kelly on GMB, the pair spoke about the unexpected pressure of dealing with a pregnancy during the coronavirus pandemic, and how they’re adjusting to life as a family.  As a clearly smitten Jake cradled the bubba in his arms, and he explained: ‘We sort of feel like we we kind of feel we’ve got a bit of a routine going.  ‘I’m doing the early shift from about seven till about one in the morning, and then I pop her into Hannah and then Hannah has the kind of graveyard shift at the moment.’  ‘This may change, and during the day, I take care of my poor wife, because despite her Sandhurst military training, it’s a tough shift!,’ they laughed.    Hannah and Jake Graf are now proud parents to a baby girl (Picture: ITV)   The pair also praised their ‘incredible’ surrogate, who they hope to remain in Millie’s life after giving birth to her.  ‘I’ve wanted to be a father since I was probably early 20s,’ Jake continued. ‘I knew that I wanted to be a parent, I’ve always looked after kids. I’ve looked after other people’s kids,  ‘I’ve worked with children for about 15-20 years of my life, and I just always knew that I wanted to be a dad and I never thought that it was possible, and obviously you know, I kind of allowed for that.’    The pair welcomed baby Millie two weeks ago (Picture: ITV)   ‘Even if I’d be the single dad, I had genetic material taken and frozen so that one day I could do it despite, you know against the odds,’ Jake explained. ‘And then I was very, very fortunate to meet my beautiful wife.  ‘The first phone call we ever had was me confirming that she would in fact be having babies with me.’  ‘Here we are five years later and I still can’t quite believe that we have this beautiful little baby,’ Jake concluded.  ‘So I spend a lot of time just staring, because I genuinely never ever thought that we would be here and it is a dream come true.’     Lorraine was clearly taken with the youngster, and who warned Hannah she would be getting away with murder because she was so cute.  Calling Millie a ‘daddy’s girl’ Hannah added that she hoped the family’s story would prove to be an inspiration for other members of the LGBT community who may have ruled out the possibility of having a family.  ‘I just never thought I would, you know, be in a position to be in a relationship or be married or have kids,’ Hannah said. ‘ Growing up as a young transgender person, I just felt that I was unlovable, because that is what the mainstream media and that is what you know everyone in society is telling you.’  ‘So the fact that I’ve found Jake, you know, we’ve got married and having another baby is amazing and we’re really happy to share that with the world,’ she added.  ‘We just want all the trans people to know that just because you’re trans doesn’t mean you should settle for less than welcome to all the joys of life, the same as everyone else.’    Good Morning Britain airs weekdays at 6am on ITV.

"Want your flowers to glow? If you’re OK with GMOs, that’s now an option  May incidentally prove useful in tracking plant development.  30 Apr 2020, 19:13 by John Timmer  Wander into the wrong section of a home improvement store and you'll discover entire aisles dedicated to a product category called ""landscape lighting."" Apparently, many people find it aesthetically pleasing to have systems to illuminate trees and flowers after the Sun goes down. If a group of Russian scientists has its way, however, the trees may ultimately be able to illuminate themselves.  A not-necessarily healthy glow  Plenty of living things glow in the dark. Some of these, like jellyfish and corals, rely on fluorescent proteins, which absorb energy at one wavelength and then re-emit it later at a visible one. Others, like fireflies, have enzymes that convert chemical energy to photons and so aren't limited by the need for a source of photons to power their glow. Typically, these latter organisms have a specific chemical—generically called a ""luciferin""—that provides the energy. An enzyme called a ""luciferase"" (again, a generic term) cleaves a chemical bond in the luciferin and releases its energy as a photon.  (The use of these generic terms can be confusing, as the terms are interchangeable but the molecules are not. If you try to feed the luciferin from bacteria to the firefly luciferase, nothing will happen. It also means that the list of molecules in the ""luciferin"" category is regularly expanding as biologist categorize more systems.)  Obviously, if you wanted to make a glow-in-the-dark plant (and honestly, who wouldn't?), you'd choose a luciferin/luciferase system rather than a fluorescent protein. Otherwise, you'd have to set up landscape lighting anyway in order to feed the fluorescent protein a steady stream of photons to make sure it glows. But choosing the luciferin/luciferase system means that you have to either supply your plant with the right chemical or, ideally, get the plant to make the chemical itself.  This has been tried and... well, the results were not optimal. Dumping firefly luciferin on plants is extremely expensive and can be toxic. Getting plants to produce a luciferin themselves is tough, since most of the metabolic pathways used to provide starting material for the chemical aren't present in plants. While there have been some attempts to engineer the pathways that make luciferins into plants, the results have been disappointing.  Bio-engineering-luminescent  The new work relies on the discovery of a new pathway in fungi that feeds on rotting wood . As you might imagine, a fungus that feeds on wood has to have some metabolic pathways that overlap with those of the plants that provide its food source. In this case, the fungus produces its luciferin through a biochemical pathway called the caffeic acid cycle. Conveniently, caffeic acid is an intermediate on the pathway that plants use to make lignin , a key component of plant cell walls and a major contributor to the robustness of wood.  It turns out that only three enzymes were needed to convert caffeic acid to a luciferin. Add in the need for a luciferase to get the glow and the researchers were looking at a total of four genes. They engineered them into a single stretch of DNA and inserted that into the cells of a tobacco plant. While tobacco may seem like an odd choice, it has been intensively researched and is often used for experiments like this.  The first bit of good news is that the production of an extra chemical made no difference to the plants. The growth, flowering, and germination time of the engineered plants was indistinguishable from those of controls. The only apparent difference was that the engineered plants are slightly taller (12 percent).  The second is that it worked. The fungal system produces a green glow, and most plant tissue is transparent at green wavelengths. The light in tissues like leaves and flowers was bright enough that it could be captured with consumer cameras instead of needing high-end imaging equipment. The researchers tested adding different luciferin precursors to the leaves and found that the conversion of caffeic acid was the big limitation on the light production, suggesting possible ways of improving the pathway.  Incidental science  The researchers don't go into their motivations for doing this, although it's clear there's an element of ""wouldn't it be neat if... "" to the whole enterprise. Still, as it turns out, these glowing plants could be scientifically valuable. The researchers find that the glow is brightest in areas that have high levels of metabolic activity, including actively growing leaves and sites of injury. It can trace the location of veins within leaves, and the researchers see a wave of activity in old leaves as they're being replaced, possibly because the plant is pulling nutrients back out of those leaves.  Finally, the researchers found they could massively boost the glow of the plants by exposing them to ripe banana skins or other sources of plant hormones. So maybe once your yard is fully planted with glowing plants, you'll need to peel some bananas before fully enjoying it at night.  And you know it's coming, because several authors disclosed that they work at a company called Planta that has filed for patents on this system.  Nature Biotechnology, 2020.

"HUL's arsenal in fight against coronavirus - balance sheet, innovation and talent  30 Apr 2020, 19:26 by Ajita Shashidhar   Hindustan Unilever is systematically reviewing all areas of cash generation and revaluating all costs in the light of the circumstance so that we can invest behind the best opportunities   Hindustan Unilever has laid down a five-pronged strategy to navigate the COVID-19 challenge. At the company's fourth quarter result announcement, CFO, Srinivas Pathak, said that supporting its people, protecting supplies, servicing demand, contributing to the society and maintaining and protecting its financial model would be its topmost priority. ""Our strong balance sheet and cash positions us well and will be a source of competitive advantage for us. We are systematically reviewing all areas of cash generation and revaluating all costs in the light of the circumstance so that we can invest behind the best opportunities. We continue to set a high ambition of savings across the value chain,"" he said.  ""HUL has a strong balance sheet, we have a great number of brands which cater to the heightened need in the area of health, hygiene and nutrition. We also have a great resilient pool of talent. We would do our best to remain competitive,"" added Sanjiv Mehta, Chairman and MD, HUL.  COVID-19 has severely impacted the FMCG major's fourth quarter performance. The disruptions created by the coronavirus lockdown has resulted in its sales declining by about 9 per cent, while volume growth decline by 7 per cent. Pathak said that half of the loss of sales could be attributed to reduced stock levels at its distribution locations as its primary distribution got disrupted. ""The balance would be from lower stock at the retailer level and loss of consumer demand,"" he further explained. The company's full year (financial year 2019-2020) domestic growth stood at 2 per cent, while net profit grew by 12 per cent. ""It was a year of strong double digit bottomline increase and with strong generation of cash,"" pointed out Pathak. Its revenue grew from Rs 38,579 crore in 2018-19 fiscal to Rs 39,136 crore in 2019-20 fiscal.   ALSO READ:  HUL posts 1.4% rise in profit at Rs 39,136 crore in FY20   While COVID-19 has indeed impacted growth adversely in the fourth quarter, Mehta also pointed out that just before the outbreak of the pandemic, the markets were already slowing down. ""If you look at the last three months ending February, we were still seeing markets slowing down from the December quarter.""  While the times ahead are unprecedented and it is difficult at this stage to estimate the timeline of recovery, Pathak said that HUL will continue to be agile and responsive and will continue to manage pressure both from liquidity as well as volatility. ""Our approach will be to protect our business model, grow competitively and contribute to the nation. Our portfolio of trusted brands, financial stability and quality of leadership teams will position us well to deal with the crisis for the changing world that will come afterwards. We also remain confident of medium to long-term growth prospects of the FMCG sector.""  Pathak said that after the initial days of the lockdown, when supplies came to a standstill, the company has been working with various authorities to scale up its operations. We are at 70 per cent of our normative levels as we speak, and we are hopeful of improving this in the coming days. We have ramped up our supplies of sanitisers and handwash. We are operating with shorter planning cycles and stepping up agility and building resilience in the supply chain.""   ALSO READ:  GSK plans to sell Rs 28,000 crore stake in Hindustan Unilever: report   While demand patterns are changing, the company expects an upswing in health, hygiene and nutrition. ""In the near term, we are likely to see adverse impact in discretionary categories and out-of-home channels. We are staying close to the consumers to adapt to the emerging patterns and bringing in relevant innovations to suit us both for the short term and for the medium term"".  HUL, in the coming months would be rolling a host of new innovations in the space of health and hygiene, which includes Lifebuoy Germ-Kill spray, Domex Germ Disinfectant spray, Domex Germ Removal Wipes and Surf Excel Anti-Germ Wash Booster. The company also plans to significantly step up innovations under the Horlicks brand. HUL has completed the GSK acquisition and from April 1 onwards, GSK brands such as Horlicks would become an integral part of its portfolio. ""We are very pleased with that acquisition and the prospects of that acquisition in our portfolio hasn't diminished at all. There might be short-term hiccups due to COVID-19 which will apply to most businesses, but we are absolutely delighted getting this great nutrition brand into HUL,"" said Mehta.  Will demand take off any time soon? Mehta said it was difficult to predict. ""At this juncture there are many variables... a lot will depend on the trajectory of the virus, what is the success of the containment effort and the severity and duration of the economic impact.""

Ukraine: UA: PBC unveils its Eurovision schedule for May  30 Apr 2020, 21:00 by Sanjay (Sergio) Jiandani   UA:PBC, the Ukrainian national broadcaster, has unveiled its Eurovision schedule after the cancellation of the 2020 Eurovision Song Contest due to the COVID-19 global pandemic. Ukrainian audience will be able to watch all 41 Eurovision entries during a series of special shows on UA:PBC 1.   The Ukrainian national broadcaster will be broadcasting a special series of shows ‘ How does Europe sing? ‘hosted by Timur Miroshnychenko (Eurovision  2017 host) where the Ukrainian audience will get to see all the 41 ESC entries with subtitles in Ukrainian and vote for their favourite entries.  Timur will introduce the Ukrainian audience to the forty one Eurovision songs along with the biographies of the competing acts.  Timur Miroshnychenko says:   Millions of Eurovision fans have been waiting for Eurovision as if it was their own birthday. We will see some of this year’s participants compete next year, but with new songs, whilst some countries will elect other representatives. If your favorite artist does not represent your country in 2021, do not worry! We will talk about all the 2020 Eurovision participants on How Does Europe Sing!   Stanislav Mednedev (UA PBC Entertainment Dept):   Eurovision is a competition for topical European music. Most of the representatives are selected via national selections: via public and professional jury deliberation.   In some countries, the choice of spectators and juries is the same (for example, as this year Go_A received the maximum from both the audience and the jury) and in other countries it is not. But I can assure you that the countries send their best songs to the Eurovision Song Contest every year, with many of them having a great potential of becoming hits.   Stanislav adds:   We invite the audience to hear the 2020 ESC songs and learn more about the participants and songs, their national selections and to cast their vote. We have translated the songs specially for our viewers at UA:PBC.   So even if you do not speak English, you will be able to understand what Europe is singing about and make conclusions about what styles of music and what topics are relevant to the lyrics.

"Federal government set to ban variety of assault-style rifles  30 Apr 2020, 21:50 by Jim Bronskill    In this Oct. 2, 2018, semi-automatic rifles fill a wall at a gun shop in Lynnwood, Wash. Starting Tuesday, Jan. 1, 2019. The federal government is poised to ban a variety of assault-style rifles. Image Credit: THE CANADIAN PRESS/AP-Elaine Thompson   OTTAWA - The federal government is poised to begin fulfilling a key electoral promise by banning a variety of assault-style rifles, including the type used in the 1989 mass shooting in Montreal.  During the fall election campaign, the Liberals said guns designed to inflict multiple human casualties have no place in Canada.  One source familiar with the plan, but not authorized to speak about it publicly, said the government intends to issue orders-in-council within days to ban several rifles, including the Ruger Mini-14 used to kill 14 women at Montreal's Ecole Polytechnique.  Owners of legally purchased firearms that fall under the ban would be offered fair-market prices through a buyback program.  Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said Thursday there is a ""large consensus"" among Canadians who want less violence and fewer deaths from firearms.  ""There is no need in Canada for guns designed to kill the largest amount of people in the shortest amount of time,"" he said during a news briefing on a number of issues.  ""We will have more to say on this when we make an announcement around what we're doing to strengthen gun control in the coming days.""  The government was almost ready to introduce measures to outlaw specific guns, including the popular AR-15 rifle, when Parliament suspended in March because of COVID-19, Trudeau said.  It also plans to empower provinces and cities to take steps to manage the storage and use of handguns within their individual jurisdictions, given that they have different concerns.  Trudeau has faced renewed questions about the pledges following the recent deadly shootings by a Nova Scotia gunman.  Public Safety Minister Bill Blair has come under pressure to move quickly on measures that do not require legislation — now even more of a factor given the severely curtailed parliamentary agenda due to the novel coronavirus.  The group PolySeSouvient, which includes students and graduates of Ecole Polytechnique, urged Blair in November to take action.  Opponents of the federal plan to outlaw some guns also question the federal timetable.  ""If this was an urgent public safety issue, why did Bill Blair and the Liberal party insist on waiting until after the 2019 federal election to even contemplate seizing and destroying these guns?"" the Canadian Shooting Sports Association asked last month.  The Canadian Sporting Arms and Ammunition Association tweeted Thursday the public should be concerned about ""this overstepping of emergency powers"" to advance an election agenda during a national crisis.  Deputy Prime Minister Chrystia Freeland told a news briefing Thursday that stricter gun control is an absolute priority that cannot wait.  ""This was one of the key planks in our election campaign, and we received a strong mandate from Canadians to act on gun control. This was our intention and it is our intention,"" she said.  ""I felt, as someone knocking on doors during the election campaign, this is something Canadians are ready for and they want, and we are going to deliver very soon.""  This report by The Canadian Press was first published April 30, 2020."	News

Galaxy Note 10 update brings May 2020 security patch - Gizchina.com  30 Apr 2020, 21:16 by Marco Lancaster  The Galaxy S20 series is composed of the most buzzing smartphones from Samsung right now. As usual, there is a major focus in these recent smartphones. However, the company keeps supporting other devices that are still part of its “support plan” as well as the last year’s flagships. Today a new update is reaching the Galaxy Note 10 smartphone.  The update is rolling out with the N97xFXXS4CTD1 software version and it is currently available in Europe. The list of countries getting this update includes France, Germany, Poland, and Switzerland. However, this update is only reaching the Exynos variants, in other words, the Global variants. The 5G version is excluded for the initial rollout, for uncertain reasons.     Galaxy Note 10 latest update is an incremental update including some small bugfixes and performance improvements. The biggest add-on is the May 2020 security patch. This is the first update to come after One UI 2.1 has been rolled out for the Galaxy Note 10 and Note 10+ devices. Interestingly enough, the OTA build includes a new bootloader (v4). That means that users won’t be able to perform manual downgrade after getting this update.  The OTA is rolling out in a gradual form. So it may take a few days to reach all eligible smartphones. Worth noting that owners of the Galaxy Note 10 with the Snapdragon 855 will have to wait a bit longer. After all, this update can’t be cross-flashed between the two variants.

"Work to rebuild this battered Swansea pier is due to start in June  Associated British Ports has appointed a contractor to replace a long section of Swansea West Pier's inner wall  30 Apr 2020, 21:08 by Richard Youle  A multi-million pound rebuild of a crumbling Swansea pier is a step closer.  Associated British Ports (ABP) has been given approval by council planning officers to rebuild a 240-metre section of Swansea West Pier's inner wall.  ABP, which owns Swansea docks, said it has appointed a contractor and that construction was due to start in June, subject to securing further licenses and approvals.  The timber and concrete inner wall has deteriorated in recent years, mainly due to winter storm surges.  Long sections of it are cordoned off to the public.    A tangle of concrete, metal and wood (Image: Richard Williams)   Emergency repairs were carried out in December 2017 and the summer of 2018, but the structure took another battering last winter.  An APB spokeswoman said: ""We continue to monitor the pier and take the necessary steps to ensure that it is safe.""  The more visible concrete metal outer pier - separating Swansea beach from the River Tawe and sometimes used by surfers - is in a better condition.  The APB spokeswoman said it aimed to minimise disruption to the nearby Tawe lock, through which boats from the marina access the bay, during construction.  The company was given a marine licence for the project, which has been estimated at around £15 million, in March by Natural Resources Wales.  It still needs Admiralty consent from the Welsh Government.  The West Pier was built in the 1800s to help shipping navigate into and out of the town’s busy docks.  Asked in 2018 if the public would have full access along the rebuilt pier wall, ABP said it was consulting on the proposal.   Read More"	NotNews

Google Meet will be available to everyone for free  30 Apr 2020, 07:30 by Ida Torres  Video conferencing will probably still be one of the top ways that companies and organizations will be meeting over the next few months. And so we’re seeing a rush with brands to be the app of choice for those meetings, digital events, and conferences. We’ve seen a lot of improvements from Google Meet the past few weeks so that they can compete with the likes of Zoom, Microsoft Teams, and Skype. Now we see probably the most crucial change that they’re making: Google Meet will now be available for free for everyone, not just G Suite users.  Technically, you could always participate in Meet video calls for free but only those with G Suite paid accounts could start calls. Starting next week, they will be expanding this feature to all users but they’re doing it gradually so you may not be able to start that meeting just yet. The only requirement is that you need to have a Google account, which most people probably have. You don’t need to download the Meet app (unless you want to) so you can join meetings on your Chrome or other browsers.  Security is, of course, a major concern for these video conferencing tools, given Zoom’s various security issues (Zoom-bombing anyone?). Google wants to highlight that Meet is built on a secure foundation. They have the usual controls like admitting or denying entry to users, muting and removing participants, etc. They also do not allow anonymous users that’s why they require users to have a Google account. The meeting codes are also complex so “brute-force guessing” will not work. If you want to have an even more secure way, you can enroll your account in the Advanced Protection Program, which has their “strongest protections available against phishing and account hijacking.”  So once Google has finished rolling it out, anyone can start and join a Google Meet by going to meet.google.com or by downloading the mobile app on Android. If you don’t have a Google account yet, you will have to create one now. Right now there’s no time limit but after September 30, the free users can only have up to 60 minutes for the video call. For more advanced features, your organization can sign up for G Suite Essentials which is free until September 30.  We’ll find out now if Google Meet can overtake Zoom as the most popular video conference tool. Previously what was stopping people was because of the G Suite limitation. Now that it’s free, there’s a chance it will garner more users, both for personal and business reasons.	News
"Land fissures, falling earth levels feared with new Arizona water rules  30 Apr 2020, 07:00 by Jean Lotus  DENVER, April 30 (UPI) -- Arizona is adopting a new regional water-use plan, and residents and geologists fear it could lead to more man-made geological changes in the landscape, including land levels falling and giant fissures splitting the earth.  As part of the Colorado River Drought Contingency Plan , approved by Gov. Doug Ducey in 2019, Arizona must curtail river water use to keep levels at Nevada's Lake Mead from dropping to dangerous levels.  The water level at the lake, near Las Vegas, has been declining since 1983. The lake is now about 40 percent full at about 1,100 feet. If it drops to 1,075 feet, a shortage would be declared and mandatory water cuts would occur throughout the U.S. West.  Farmers, facing drought conditions, want to return to ground pumping of the state's already-low ancient underground aquifers. Elsewhere in the state, where water is not regulated, out-of-state agriculture operations have moved in to drain underground water supplies.  ""Arizona's challenges to manage its groundwater have implications for all other water use across the West,"" said John Fleck, a professor of water resources at University of New Mexico.   Pumping since 1900   Arizona's farmers have been pumping groundwater out of aquifers since 1900, and over-pumping has caused the ground levels to fall in 3,400 square miles of the state, geological mapping shows. Large fissures, some miles long, have opened up where land has collapsed.  Earth fissures can open overnight, usually after monsoon season in June through September, said Chris Wanamaker, assistant engineer in Pinal County, where most of the state's fissures are found.  At first, a small crack in the earth appears where the ground-level has dropped due to over-pumping, Wanamaker said. ""A heavy rain brings water runoff into the crack, which can cause the land to erode suddenly as it collapses into the void,"" he said.  ""It's kind of Biblical, when you think about the earth opening up, like an apocalypse or something,"" said Joseph Cook, a research scientist and fissures expert at the Arizona Geological Survey at Tucson's University of Arizona.  For residents, the fissures cause heartache, flooding and damage.  Queen Creek resident Joan Etzenhouser  has four fissures, including one under her house, on her 3-acre property about 30 miles southeast of Phoenix. After monsoon rainfalls, the fissures sometimes open into gaping trenches, 6 to 10 feet wide and 30 feet deep.   Broken water lines   The moving ground under her home has broken water lines twice and cracked tiles inside, Etzenhouser said. She's filled the gap under her home with cement slurry.  ""It can't really be fixed because a fissure is impossible to fix,"" she said. ""I like where I live, but nobody's going to buy it. It's a worthless house on a worthless piece of property.""  The county now keeps maps of earth fissures, county engineer Wanamaker said. Officials recommend that developers not build within 50 feet of them.  In other parts of the state, free, unregulated underground water has lured large agricultural operations that drill deep wells and drain the aquifers, causing the land to collapse.  In Cochise County, southeast of Tucson, cattle operations and nut-tree farmers pump so much underground water that the land has deflated by more than 10 feet since 1969.  About 42 miles of fissures have opened up, damaging a natural gas pipeline, roads, and power lines over the past decade, according to the state's geologists.  ""The domestic wells are drying up,"" Willcox Mayor Mike Walls told UPI. ""It's horrible. The big boys come in here with a lot of money and keep going after the water deeper and deeper.""  In La Paz County, in the western part of the state, severe floods in Wendon, Ariz., have been caused by land collapse from over-pumped aquifers.   Saudis grow alfalfa   Saudi Arabian growers of water-intensive alfalfa drilled deep wells and now export hay to Europe and the Middle East.  Shallow domestic wells for rural residents have run dry, Kingman, Ariz., Republican state Rep. Regina Cobb said.  ""Whoever has the big straw is the one that is able to draw the water out,"" Cobb said.  Cobb and other lawmakers faced opposition when they tried to pass locally controlled water management laws.  What's worse, local residents and water experts worry that once Arizona's underground water is gone, it might never come back, and the land will continue to collapse.  When too much water is taken from aquifers, pressure compacts the space between grains of sand and gravel, said Brian Conway, geophysics surveying unit supervisor for the Arizona Department of Water Resources.  ""If you put a straw in there and suck all the milk out, the Rice Krispies are going to come together and compact,"" Conway said. ""That's what's happening in the subsurface. It's hard for that to ever hold water again.""  Continue Reading   RELATED"	NotNews
"Trump Claims China 'Will Do Anything They Can' to Sabotage His 2020 Reelection  In a Reuters interview Wednesday, US President Donald Trump said that China “will do anything they can to have [him] lose” the 2020 presidential election.   30 Apr 2020, 00:20   He also noted that he is considering different potential consequences for China regarding its handling of the coronavirus pandemic, claiming that he “can do a lot.” He added that the US trade deal with China has been “upset very badly” by the coronavirus. In addition, Trump stated on Monday that his administration was conducting ""serious investigations"" into China's handling of the crisis and would seek damages for the US.  “We’re doing very serious investigations ... We are not happy with China. We believe it could have been stopped at the source. It could have been stopped quickly and it wouldn’t have spread all over the world,"" Trump said Monday during the daily coronavirus briefing.  Trump's comments come after White House trade adviser Peter Navarro accused China of sending low-quality and counterfeit COVID-19 antibody testing kits to the US and of ""profiteering"" from the outbreak.  Washington has accused China of hiding the coronavirus epidemic when it first broke out in January and has ramped up such accusations in recent weeks. Earlier this month, Trump said he was going to halt funding to the World Health Organization, claiming that the international health watchdog covered up the spread of the infection after it was first reported in China.  This is not the first time Trump has accused China of interfering with his political standing. In 2018, Trump claimed that Beijing was trying to meddle with the midterm elections because he had imposed tariffs on billions of dollars worth of Chinese goods. During a United Nations Security Council meeting at the time, Trump said : “They do not want me or us to win because I am the first president to ever challenge China on trade.”"	News
Elon Musk ripped US infrastructure, calling many American airports an 'embarrassment', Business Insider - Business Insider Singapore  30 Apr 2020, 00:24 by Mark Matousek, Business Insider US   Tesla CEO Elon Musk criticized US infrastructure on Wednesday, calling for new investment.  “It’s really quite sad that US infrastructure, especially roads and highways, is where it is today,” Musk said.  The US should focus on infrastructure projects that are oriented toward the future, Musk added.  Visit Business Insider’s homepage for more stories .   Tesla CEO Elon Musk slammed US infrastructure on Wednesday during the electric-car maker’s first-quarter earnings call, saying it was in need of new investment.  “I think it’s high time we invested in infrastructure in this country,” Musk said when asked what message he would send to the US government for the years after the country recovers from the spread of the novel coronavirus.  “We have a lot of crumbling highways and bridges and, frankly, when I visit China, I see their infrastructure as being much better than ours. It’s great. Europe has better infrastructure. It’s really quite sad that US infrastructure, especially roads and highways, is where it is today,” Musk said. “And our airports, in a lot of cases, are an embarrassment.”  Improving US infrastructure will require money to be spent wisely on projects that are oriented toward the future, Musk added.  “Sometimes we spend a lot of money on these things, but what do we gain for it? We really need to be thinking about what is the transportation of the future, not the transportation of the past,” he said.  The American Society of Civil Engineers (ASCE) has criticized the state of American infrastructure, giving it a grade of D+ in its 2017 report card , the most recent one the organization has published. At the time, the ASCE estimated the US would have to spend $4.59 trillion by 2025 to make the necessary improvements.  Tesla announced a surprise first-quarter profit on Wednesday, saying it made $1.24 per share, on an adjusted basis, on revenue of $5.99 billion, despite factory closures and sales disruptions caused by the spread of the novel coronavirus.

"Dortmund focus on Ansu Fati as replacement for Jadon Sancho  30 Apr 2020 by BeSoccer   'Sport' announced this Thursday morning that Borussia Dortmund are interested in signing Ansu Fati this summer presumably to replace Jadon Sancho.   On Thursday there was a big news story running in the press in Barcelona. According to 'Sport', Borussia Dortmund have focussed on  Ansu Fati . The German outfit apparently see the academy player as the perfect substiture for Jadon Sancho .  Months ago it was taken for granted that the English winger will leave Signal Iduna Park in the summer to presumably go to Manchester United. Now Dortmund are looking for a quality substitute for him.  Obviously, they want to sign him because in October he will turn 18 and he has a bright future ahead of him. Barca will obviously not agree to sell him. However, 'Sport' says Barca could let him go out on loan .  According to the newspaper, the Catalan outfit have  ""asked for time to decide, but will only contemplate a loan deal or a sale with the option to buy him back.""  Ansu Fati made his debut this season and broke several club records in La Liga and the Champions League. Josep Maria Bartomeu made sure he got an improved contract to prevent other clubs from snapping him up. When he turns 18, he will have a new deal which will include a 170 million euro buyout clause.  The report also says that Quique Setien will refuse to let Ansu Fati go despite the fact the club are working on buying either Neymar or Lautaro.

Oil Steams Along With Gains as Norway Throws Hat Into Ring With Cuts  30 Apr 2020 by Investing.com  By Barani Krishnan  Investing.com - Norway, Western Europe’s largest oil producer, said on Thursday it was joining OPEC and rest of the world in output cuts, giving crude prices double-digit gains for a second day as bulls in the market bet on demand recovery from the coronavirus pandemic.  West Texas Intermediate, the New York-traded benchmark for U.S. crude, still ended April with a monthly loss after its previous front-month contract fell to subzero levels last week.  But Brent, the London-traded global benchmark for oil, posted double-digit gains for April, in a sign that the worst may be behind energy markets.  “I’d say that as much as we should not underweight the fundamentals, we should not underestimate the firepower of charging bulls who have long been waiting to action that buy button,” said Igor Windisch at the Geneva-based IBW Oil Brief.  “But I would stay cautious. As of tomorrow, OPEC+ cuts will start to bring support to prices. But for how long? How much of those cuts are already priced in? I would say all of it.”  June WTI settled up $3.78, or 25%, at $18.84 per barrel. For the month, it fell 8%.  July Brent closed up $2.25, or 9%, at $26.48. It rose 16% for April.  Both WTI and Brent prices have rallied since Tuesday. The New York-traded benchmark jumped 25% in the previous session, powered by optimism over the relative success of clinical trials for potential Covid-19 drug, remdesivir, and a smaller-than-expected build in U.S. crude stockpiles for last week. The U.K. oil gauge rose nearly 7% on Wednesday, tracking WTI’s gains.  Thursday’s run-up came after Norway said it will cut output by 250,000 barrels daily in June and 134,000 barrels per day in the second half of the year.  OPEC, meanwhile, has a target to reduce 9.7 million bpd from global supply.  The cuts have reduced market fears that space for storing oil in both the United States and the world may be running out. The Cushing, Okla. hub for WTI physical deliveries has been reported to be weeks away from hitting capacity while global oil tanker operators say few VLCCs, or Very Large Crude Carriers, are left with leasing space.  Yet, the Trump administration provided some relief to U.S. producers to store immediate supplies of oil that the market had little need for, by providing nine companies leasing space for 23 million barrels in total in underground salt caverns owned by the government’s Strategic Petroleum Reserve. The companies that got the reprieve were Chevron (NYSE: CVX ), Exxon Mobil (NYSE: XOM ), Alon USA,  Atlantic Trading, Energy Transfer (NYSE: ET ), Equinor Marketing & Trading, Mercuria Energy, MVP Holdings and Vitol.  Also on the oil companies front, Chesapeake Energy (NYSE: CHK ), which was at the forefront of the U.S. shale boom of the past decade, was preparing a potential bankruptcy filing, Reuters reported. If true, it would be the second bankruptcy filing by a major U.S. energy company — after Whiting Petroleum’s in early April — inflicted by the Covid-19 crisis.  Production cuts notwithstanding, storage concerns continued to weigh on markets with the International Energy Agency warning that global capacity could reach its maximum by mid-June and that energy demand could slump by a record 6% in 2020 due to lockdowns.  “If the already-stretched storage capacity is getting fuller and fuller every week, a rise in prices cannot be sustainable for long as the problem is not really resolved”, Rystad Energy’s head of oil markets Bjornar Tonhauge said.  “At around 80-90% full, traders keep on seeing the storage glass as half empty when it is not even half full. It’s close to overflowing, even at a lower speed.”  The U.S. economy, meanwhile, continues to shed jobs, with another 3.8 million Americans filing for unemployment claims for the first time last week, bringing to around 30 million the number of jobs lost to Covid-19.

New York reportedly paid $69 million for ventilators to an engineer with no background in medical supplies at the recommendation of the White House coronavirus task force  30 Apr 2020, 00:52 by Sonam Sheth      U.S. President Trump. Reuters    New York state paid $US69 million for ventilators to an engineer with no background in medical supplies after he tweeted at President Donald Trump and the White House coronavirus task force recommended him as a vendor, BuzzFeed News reported.  The ventilators reportedly never arrived.  New York has since terminated its contract with the man, a Silicon Valley electrical engineer named Yaron Oren-Pines, and is working to recover its money.  Reached for comment by phone, Oren-Pines told BuzzFeed News, “Neither me nor my company is providing any comment on this,” and hung up.  Visit Business Insider’s homepage for more stories .    The state of New York paid $US69 million for ventilators to a man with no background in medical supplies after he tweeted at President Donald Trump and the White House coronavirus task force recommended him as a vendor, BuzzFeed News reported .  The ventilators never arrived.  On March 27, as the novel coronavirus was surging through the US, Trump urged Ford and General Motors on Twitter to “START MAKING VENTILATORS, NOW!”  Yaron Oren-Pines, an electrical engineer in Silicon Valley, replied to the tweet, writing, “We can supply ICU Ventilators, invasive and noninvasive. Have someone call me URGENT.”  BuzzFeed reported that New York shelled out $US69.1 million to Oren-Pines three days later for 1,450 ventilators – at least three times the standard price for high-end models. A state official told the outlet that New York entered into the contract with Oren-Pines at the “direct recommendation” of the White House coronavirus task force. It’s unclear who specifically authorised the recommendation.  New York has since terminated the contract and the state is reportedly trying to recover its money. Reached for comment by phone, Oren-Pines told BuzzFeed News, “Neither me nor my company is providing any comment on this,” and hung up.  In a similar case earlier this month, the Trump administration awarded a $US55 million contract to a bankrupt company with no employees for N95 masks, according to The Washington Post.  The company, Panthera Worldwide LLC, describes itself as a tactical training company for the US military and other government agencies, has no record of producing medical supplies or equipment, The Post said.  Panthera’s parent company filed for bankruptcy protection last fall, and one of its owners last year said it’d had no employees since May 2018, The Post reported, citing sworn testimony. It is no longer listed as an LLC in Virginia, where its main office is located, after fees went unpaid.  The World Health Organisation declared the coronavirus, which causes a disease known as COVID-19, a pandemic last month.  As of Wednesday evening, 3,187,030 people around the world have been infected, and the US is the global epicentre of the outbreak, with more than one million confirmed cases.  New York is the hardest-hit state , with 305,024 cases and 23,317 deaths. Gov. Andrew Cuomo said on Wednesday that the death rate in the state has been flat for three consecutive days but that the number of new hospital admissions for the coronavirus increased slightly for the first time in 12 days.

Ex-SAS veteran turned clergyman who served in Northern Ireland during The Troubles is defrocked after subjecting his wife to long-term domestic abuse  30 Apr 2020, 00:43 by Jack Wright For Mailonline    Rev'd Paul Parks of St Helen's Church in Hastings has been removed from office    He admitted charges of domestic abuse to a church misconduct panel    Parks subjected his wife to a 'clear pattern' of 'violent and aggressive behaviour'    Clergyman had previously served in Northern Ireland during The Troubles      The Rev'd Paul Parks has been removed from office after admitting to domestic violence   An SAS veteran turned clergyman who served in Northern Ireland during The Troubles has been defrocked after subjecting his wife to domestic abuse.  The Rev'd Paul Parks of St Helen's Church in Hastings, East Sussex, 60, has been removed from office and banned from the Church of England for two years by a church misconduct panel.  He admitted a number of allegations of abuse made by his 61-year-old wife Lois Parks, both verbal and physical before the Bishop's Disciplinary Tribunal.  Parks, who became an ordained Priest in 1999 after serving the Armed Forces as a Para between 1975 and 1981 and the elite SAS after 1986, married Lois in 2003.  He was prone to fits of jealous rage, the panel heard, including two episodes during their engagement in which Parks called Lois a 'cheap whore'. After their honeymoon, he 'pushed his new wife down on the floor, and stood over her screaming and shouting'.  In 2005, Lois made allegations of 'abusive and manipulative behaviour' against Parks, telling church bosses he sent 'abusive text messages', held her in an arm lock, and drove at high speed towards a brick wall while she was in the passenger seat.    Parks, who became an ordained Priest in 1999 after serving the Armed Forces as a Para between 1975 and 1981 and the elite SAS after 1986, married Lois in 2003   Parks 'admitted his violent and aggressive behaviour' but refused to fully cooperate with Bishop Stephen Cottrell, then of Reading, after he was referred to a psychologist, the Bishop's Disciplinary Tribunal heard.  When Lois was ill following the birth of her youngest son in 2011, Parks refused to allow her to leave her bed 'for a period of some hours'.  The panel heard that Parks 'threatened to kill her and called her Jezabel'.  In 2017, Lois finally contacted the police after Parks held a 'dagger-shaped letter opener' towards her face and threatened to kill her.     Parks served in Northern Ireland The Troubles     Lois Parker   Parks (left, as a Para) was prone to fits of jealous rage, the panel heard, including two episodes before their marriage in which Parks called Lois (right) a 'cheap whore'   After Parks was arrested and interviewed under caution, though, Lois withdrew her support for any prosecution after he was admitted to a psychiatric unit.  The Bishop's Disciplinary Tribunal ruled that a 'clear pattern of domestic abuse throughout the marriage' had been demonstrated.  It removed Parks from his role on account of his 'extremely serious' misconduct, and the 'enormous reputational damage to the Church' caused by it.   RELATED ARTICLES	NotNews
Nokia posts strong Q1 2020 resulting in a profitable quarter. 5G momentum continues  30 Apr 2020, 09:35 by Nayan  Nokia has posted earnings for the first quarter of 2020 today. The major positives are continued 5G  momentum with 70 commercial deals and 21 live networks and strong growth in Nokia software and enterprise.  Nokia has not only improved its margins in Q1 2020 but has also raked in a small profit because of this improved margin and cost reduction efforts. Here are the earning highlights.  Earning highlights:   Non-IFRS net sales in Q1 2020 were EUR 4.9bn, compared to EUR 5.1bn in Q1 2019. Reported net sales in Q1 2020 were EUR 4.9bn, compared to EUR 5.0bn in Q1 2019. On a constant currency basis, non-IFRS net sales decreased 4% and reported net sales decreased 3%. Excluding one-time licensing net sales in Q1 2020 and Q1 2019, net sales decreased 2% on both a non-IFRS and reported basis. This reflected good operational performance and the competitiveness of our offerings, given the negative impact of COVID-19 on the overall market environment. We estimate that COVID-19 had an approximately EUR 200 million negative impact on our Q1 2020 net sales, primarily due to supply chain challenges; with these net sales expected to be shifted to future periods, rather than being lost.  Non-IFRS diluted EPS in Q1 2020 was EUR 0.01, compared to negative EUR 0.02 in Q1 2019, primarily driven by higher gross profit in Mobile Access within Networks and Nokia Software, continued progress related to our cost savings program and a net positive fluctuation in financial income and expenses. This was partially offset by higher investments in 5G R&D to accelerate our product roadmaps and cost competitiveness in Mobile Access, income taxes and a net negative fluctuation in Nokia’s venture fund investments.  Reported diluted EPS in Q1 2020 was negative EUR 0.02, compared to negative EUR 0.08 in Q1 2019, primarily driven by higher gross profit in Mobile Access within Networks and Nokia Software, lower amortization of acquired intangible assets and our continued progress related to our cost savings program. This was partially offset by higher investments in 5G R&D to accelerate our product roadmaps and cost competitiveness in Mobile Access, income taxes and a net negative fluctuation in Nokia’s venture fund investments.  In Q1 2020, net cash and current financial investments (“net cash”) decreased sequentially by approximately EUR 0.4 billion, resulting in a net cash balance of approximately EUR 1.3 billion. Total cash and current financial investments (“total cash”) increased sequentially by EUR 0.3 billion, resulting in a total cash balance of approximately EUR 6.3 billion. This reflected strong cash performance in Q1 2020, which is a seasonally weak quarter. During Q1, we prudently strengthened our liquidity position by drawing on the EUR 500 million facility we had signed with European Investment Bank in 2018. Additionally, we have a EUR 1.5 billion revolving credit facility that has not been drawn upon to date, and we continue to explore prudent opportunities to further strengthen our liquidity.   CEO’s statement:  Nokia’s solid first quarter results showed broad year-on-year profitability improvements as our transformation and product cost reduction efforts started to take hold. On a year-on-year basis, group-level non-IFRS operating margin was up by 3.6 percentage points; Networks gross margin increased by 3.5 percentage points; Nokia Software had an excellent quarter with sharp margin improvements and strong momentum with customers in North America; and, Nokia Enterprise delivered double-digit sales growth. As I noted last quarter, we continue to have a sharp focus on Mobile Access and cash generation and saw good progress in both areas in the first quarter. “5G powered by ReefShark” shipments continue to increase and product cost reductions are proceeding well. We also announced some leading new solutions in the quarter, including a unique approach to dynamic spectrum sharing that is in test mode with select major customers today, and is expected to be available in volume over the summer, in line with the availability of DSS-capable mobile devices. On the services side, ongoing execution improvements drove improved year-on-year profitability. We also enhanced our total cash position to €6.3 billion, while net cash showed an expected seasonal decline to €1.3 billion. These improvements are, of course, coming at a time of unprecedented change, given the impact of COVID-19. Our top focus areas are protecting our employees, maintaining critical network infrastructure for customers, and ensuring we have a strong cash position. In Q1, we saw a top line impact from COVID-19 issues of approximately €200 million, largely the result of supply issues associated with disruptions in China. We are adjusting the mid-points within our previously disclosed Outlook ranges for full-year 2020 to reflect the increased risks and uncertainty presented by the ongoing COVID-19 situation. We expect the majority of this COVID-19 impact to be in Q2 and believe that our industry is fairly resilient to the crisis, although not immune. We did not see a decline in demand in the first quarter. As the COVID-19 situation develops, however, an increase in supply and delivery challenges in a number of countries is possible and some customers may reassess their spending plans. Pleasingly, despite the majority of our R&D employees working from home, we have not seen any impact on our roadmaps, and, in fact, some key software releases are proceeding ahead of schedule. Additionally, we saw a massive increase in network capacity demands. In close, Nokia’s vision of creating the technology to connect the world has never been more important than today. I want to thank our employees for their incredible resilience, ongoing support for each other whilst working from home, and their commitment to continued delivery of critical networks during this time. Equally, I want to thank our customers, suppliers, communities and the entire Nokia extended “family” for their ongoing support.	News

‘Show evidence I’m IPOB’s sponsor’ — Alex Otti replies Ikpeazu  30 Apr 2020, 09:58 by Chinedu Asadu   Alex Otti, former governorship candidate of the All Progressives Grand Alliance (APGA) in Abia, has asked Okezie Ikpeazu, the state governor, to show proof of his alleged sponsorship of the Indigenous People of Biafra (IPOB).   Otti made the demand while responding to a petition Ikpeazu allegedly wrote to the Police Service Commission against him, accusing him of sponsoring the secessionist group.  The governor was alleged to have accused him of being behind the removal of Ene Okon, the state commissioner of police, for failing to release one Emperor Ogbonna whom he said is an ally of Otti.  Reacting via a statement on Thursday, Otti said he does not know Ogbonna and had only intervened in his detention out of concern.  “To set the records straight, I do not know Emperor Ogbonna. I have never met nor spoken to him. So the allegation of him being sponsored by me is laughable,”he said.  “When the plight of the young man was brought to my attention and by then he had been incarcerated for about 3 weeks, I picked up my phone and called CP Okon. I started by telling him that I did not know Mr. Ogbonna but as an Abia citizen, I thought I should intervene.  “I reminded him that this is a democracy and warned him about being used by the Governor and his co travelers to abuse the fundamental human rights of Abians including Emperor Ogbonna.  Otti also said the allegation he is sponsoring IPOB is to “pitch me against the authorities”.  “I make bold to challenge Ikpeazu to come up with proofs to show that I am the sponsor of IPOB or forever hide his head in shame,” he said.  “I consider this as a cheap attempt to pitch me against the authorities which will fail. It was actually his incompetence in dealing with the a small insurrection that ballooned into the python dance.”  The former governorship candidate asked the governor to withdraw the said petition and tender “an unreserved apology to me for defaming my character and false accusation”.

Tractor ride to liquor store  30 Apr 2020, 09:04 by Jon Manchester     Photo: RCMP    A Lake Country man discovered that driving a lawn tractor on public streets was not the road to greener pastures.  RCMP responded to a complaint about the dubious driving on Monday, at 11 a.m.  Police located the man, who was driving home on the lawn tractor, having just come from a nearby liquor store, says Cpl. Mike Halskov with the B.C. Highway Patrol.  The man showed signs of impairment and refused to provide a breath sample. He was served with a 90-day driving prohibition, and the lawn tractor was impounded.  Police also served the man with tickets for no insurance and no driver's licence.  Halskov reminds that impaired driving is illegal, no matter what type of motorized conveyance is being driven, and that COVID-19 is not an excuse to disregard the law.	News
Robert Pattinson Deemed The Most Perfect, Beautiful Man  30 Apr 2020, 09:50 by Charisse Van Horn  Long before Christopher Nolan cast Robert Pattinson as Batman or cosmetic surgeon Dr. Julian De Silva used his mathematical Golden Ratio to determine Robert Pattinson was 91 percent a hunk and the most beautiful, perfect man alive, Dior Parfums was already let in on the secret. Robert Pattinson has been the face of Dior Homme (which literally means man) since 2013 and the campaign has proved to be one of Dior’s wisest in terms of marketing.  In a sense, many people feel they have watched Robert Pattinson grow up on the silver screen. Since playing Cedric Diggory in Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire , and then moving on to Twilight -cult status as Edward Cullen, fans have watched him tackle challenging roles (he was robbed from critical acclaim for his performance as Salvador Dali in Little Ashes ) and finally earn the credit he is due. His work in The Lighthouse as Thomas Howard was mesmerizing and while the world awaits the release of The Batman, they can enjoy watching Robert Pattinson as he stars in the latest Dior Homme ads.  The Homme ads feature work from the late Leonard Cohen (who sings “I’m Your Man”) and photographer Mikael Jansson and the official Dior Parfums Instagram account has several videos and photos of Robert that aren’t in the commercials.  You may see a video of Robert Pattinson dancing then turning his head to look straight at the camera with a stare many have compared to a young Marlon Brandon from A Streetcar Named Desire below .     Here is the latest Dior Homme official campaign starring Robert Pattinson.     Robert Pattinson has been working out for his role as Bruce Wayne in the upcoming movie The Batman. In the photos below, it is clear to see that Rob wasn’t starting from an empty slate. Check out the photos below where Robert is flexing his back muscles and showing off his well-defined arms.     Dior’s perfumer Francois Demachy discusses the inspiration for Homme in the video player below.     Robert Pattinson isn’t just the face of Dior, but he is a fashionista himself and attends Dior’s fashion shows. Robert plays and writes his own music and has been lending his songs to a  number of film projects but he also began modeling in his younger years. At 33-years-old, Robert Pattinson has discredited his younger modeling work, but it appears he judges himself too harshly. In truth, he never stopped modeling as his Dior Homme ads attest.     You may see additional photos and videos of Robert Pattinson for Dior Homme below.     Here is one of Robert Pattinson’s earlier ads for Dior Homme Sport.     What do you think about the research that says Robert Pattinson is the most beautiful man? Do you agree with the Golden Ration of beauty?

Minister admits Government could miss 100,000-a-day testing target  NHS Providers said health workers will need to be tested once a week to control the spread of coronavirus once the lockdown is eased.   30 Apr 2020, 09:07   Justice Secretary Robert Buckland has admitted the Government may not meet its goal of 100,000 daily coronavirus tests, but he praised colleague Matt Hancock for being “bold” in setting the target.  Mr Buckland said the Government is “well on its way” to hitting the number and the Health Secretary deserves praise “even if the target isn’t met today”.  Downing Street has insisted the Government is “working hard” to hit the target of carrying out 100,000 tests.  As of April 28, testing capacity had been increased to 77,365.  The Prime Minister’s official spokesman said: “You can chart the progress that we’ve made towards hitting that target and that we are working hard today to ensure that people who need tests get them.”  It came as NHS Providers, which represents hospitals and NHS trusts in England, described the target as a “red herring” which has distracted attention from failings in the long-term Covid-19 strategy.  NHS Providers chief executive Chris Hopson added that as many as 120,000 tests would be needed daily for NHS workers once the UK comes out of lockdown, to stave off a second wave of the virus.     With just over 52,000 tests carried out on Tuesday, the Government must make up a huge gap to achieve the goal before Friday.  Speaking on BBC Breakfast, Mr Buckland acknowledged the target could be missed, adding: “Even if it isn’t met, we’re well on our way to ramping this up and 100,000 is an important milestone, but frankly we need more.  “Yes, 52,000 isn’t 100,000, I know that… but we are straining every sinew to get there.  “If he (Matt Hancock) hadn’t set a target he would have been criticised for being unambitious. I think now is the time in respect of this to be bold… being brave is something we should acknowledge even if the target isn’t met today.”    Robert Buckland (Jeff Overs/BBC/PA)   With 800,000 people working for the NHS, Mr Hopson said there would need to be between 110,00 and 120,000 tests a day for them to be tested once a week.  Speaking to BBC Breakfast, he added: “There are still health and care workers showing symptoms who are not able to get tests because we are still struggling with capacity and some of the testing centres are too far away.”  Mr Hopson urged the Government to update its coronavirus strategy and to make good its promise to increase testing capacity.    (PA Graphics)   Mr Hopson said: “The focus on ‘are we are going to perform 100,000 tests a day’ is really a red herring because all it does is measure how many tests get performed today.  “What we need to know is what are we going to do in terms of the testing regime over the next six, eight, 10, 12 weeks as we come out of lockdown.”  He pointed to mass testing capabilities in Germany and South Korea, saying: “If you look at the international experience, having the right testing regime is absolutely crucial in conquering this virus.  “We are in a new phase, we are about to try and exit lockdown. If we are going to control the spread of the virus it’s really important we test all staff and patients regularly in healthcare settings.  “What we are missing is we haven’t got the strategy in terms of what the next phase looks like.”  Meanwhile, initial findings of a study aimed at tracking the spread of coronavirus in the general population are expected to be presented early next week.  Around 20,000 households in England were contacted to take part in the first wave of the research by the Office for National Statistics (ONS) and Department of Health and Social Care.  All participants were asked to conduct a swab test to see whether they currently have the virus, while adults in 1,000 households were providing blood samples to find out whether they had previously had Covid-19 and developed antibodies.  The Prime Minister’s spokesman said: “The ONS exercise is making good progress, I think we said that we hope to be in a position to say something about the early results at the start of May and that remains the case.”	News
Cyber attack campaigns exploiting COVID-19 with global impact  30 Apr 2020, 09:02 by Panda Security  Over the past few months, researchers at Panda Security have noted an increase in malicious social engineering campaigns using the global COVID-19 pandemic as a hook. As the crisis deepens, the number of related malicious domains, spam, malware and ransomware attacks has increased. With a large portion of the workforce now working from home, the attack surface has increased dramatically – creating more opportunities for cyber criminals.   Spam   Recently, researchers have observed an increase in COVID-19 related spam e-mails that were not limited to specific regions, but common around the world. The e-mails feature enticing subject lines such as ‘official’ updates and information about the virus, or delayed delivery schedules due to COVID-19. As with most spam campaigns, they prompt the receiver to open malicious attachments.   Malware and ransomware   Using online monitoring maps, hackers have been able to identify high-traffic sites in order to replace them with fake sites that facilitate the installation of malware. Panda Security’s 100% attestation service has allowed researchers to identify and block malicious executables, including new ransomware variants CoronaVirus & CovidLock. CovidLock originates from a malicious Android app that supposedly helps track COVID-19 cases, but instead the malicious executable blocks the user’s device and demands a ransom.   Indicators of compromise   Organisations that have implemented an advanced endpoint security (EDR) technology supplemented with a patch management service need not be too concerned about these kinds of threats. Solutions like Panda Adaptive Defense 360, with its 100% attestation service, monitor all processes and block malicious or potentially malicious processes from running. However, it is important to maintain a multi-layered approach that speaks to current threats.

Here’s Weird Al As Ted Nugent On The Reno 911! Revival  30 Apr 2020, 09:44 by Tom Breihan  Reno 911! cannot be killed. Way back in 2003, a bunch of former cast members of The State launched the Cops -style mockumentary, which ran for six seasons on Comedy Central. The series also spun off a 2007 movie, Reno 911!: Miami . And next week, Reno 911! will return as a daily series on the new meant-for-phones short-clips streaming service Quibi, also the home of the Chance The Rapper-hosted Punk’d reboot . The new season of Reno 911! will have appearances from luminaries like Tim Allen, Patton Oswalt, Dave Holmes, and Ron Perlman. It’ll also feature comedy-rock god “Weird Al” Yankovic in the role he was born to play.  On one episode of that new Reno 911! season, Yankovic will appear as Ted Nugent, the ’70s-vintage guitar-rock deity and current foaming-at-the-mouth right-wing psychopath. Yankovic has parodied dozens of rock and pop stars over the years, but he’s never taken on Nugent before. As far as I can tell, the only time Yankovic and Nugent have ever overlapped was when they both made cameos in the Ramones’ 1986 video for “ Something To Believe In ,” a parody of “We Are The World”-style all-star singalongs.  Behold the glory of Yankovic-as-Nugent:     Yankovic appears extremely briefly in the trailer for the new Reno 911! season, yelling at someone and making a fuss in what appears to be a backstage hallway. Here’s that trailer:     The new Reno 911! season debuts 5/4 on Quibi.	NotNews

Todrick Hall says The Greatest Dancer axe was 'for the best'  30 Apr 2020, 09:03 by Louise Griffin  Todrick Hall has spoken out on The Greatest Dancer being axed by the BBC , admitting it’s ‘for the best’ as he releases his new EP, Quarantine Queen.  The musician and RuPaul’s Drag Race star has been a dance captain on the show alongside, Cheryl, Matthew Morrison, and Oti Mabuse for the last series, but has revealed he’s ready for the next chapter in his life.  Speaking to Metro.co.uk , Todrick explained: ‘I’m so grateful for my time on The Greatest Dancer and the people’s lives that I’ve touched.  ‘It is sad news for any future dancers that were going to go on the show but there will be other dance shows, other auditions, other opportunities, and I’m sure that my relationship with Cheryl, Matthew and Oti, even Curtis, was only just beginning.’  The star added: ‘I’m sad to hear that news but I think it’s for the best.  ‘They can’t have audiences, we would be needing to start shooting in the next few months and they wouldn’t be able to have audiences together which is a huge key component to that show, the audience votes to open up the mirror. The entire concept can’t happen if people aren’t able to sit together in audiences.’    Todrick mentored young dance troupe Dancepoint for the latest series (Picture: Getty Images)   The Attention hitmaker pointed out: ‘I’m so excited that I got to do that show while it was still on and who knows? It might come back or come to America or go to Australia, there’s talk of other opportunities so I’m just taking it day by day, step by step, and waiting for whatever opportunity’s going to knock on my door because I’m always ready to answer it.’  Todrick is certain he’ll stay close with his fellow dance captains, explaining: ‘I have talked to Matthew, Oti, Curtis and Cheryl separately [during lockdown].  ‘I just talked to Cheryl a couple of days ago and I texted with Oti yesterday. We just have such a great bond from being there for so long. It’s so awesome that I’m able to speak to them whenever and they’re always so responsive.    Todrick sees his co-stars as his ‘London family’ (Picture: Getty Images)   ‘Oti couldn’t be more supportive of everything that I do, she’s always putting out videos of her dancing in her kitchen to my song, I love her and I love the entire team and the crew.  ‘I feel like now they’re my London family so when I come back I can’t wait to see them all again.’  The BBC show was axed after two series, with a spokesperson telling Metro.co.uk in a statement: ‘Whilst there are no plans for a further series, we are proud of the show and would like to thank everyone involved.’     Meanwhile, Todrick has definitely been keeping himself busy in isolation, creating and releasing an entire EP about lockdown, with his video for his new song Mask, Gloves, Soap, Scrubs featuring the likes of Nicole Scherzinger and Little Mix.  Chatting about the idea behind the new release, Todrick said he thought ‘it would be so much fun to give people something to make them forget about the negative news that they’re seeing.  ‘I know it’s all important, and something that shouldn’t be belittled, but right now, more than ever, people need things to uplift them.’  He added: ‘I wanted to be careful about not offending anyone but also doing something that makes people want to smile and get up and dance.’    Todrick’s EP Quarantine Queen is out now on Spotify and Apple Music .

"Contact-tracing App Must Protect People’s Privacy  30 Apr 2020, 09:46 by Amnesty International  Amnesty International says the new contact-tracing app expected to be rolled out in the next few weeks may be a useful tool in our journey to a COVID-19-free New Zealand, but checks and balances must be assured to protect people's rights.  Amnesty International Aotearoa New Zealand Advocacy and Policy Manager Annaliese Johnston says data privacy and surveillance internationally is becoming an increasing concern.  ""Everyone has the right to health, which includes protection from COVID-19 and the use of technology can, and should be, an essential tool in our efforts to eliminate it. But it also has the potential to erode trust if the way in which technology is used is not completely transparent. The public need to know exactly what privacy protections will be in place.""  Johnston says there are human rights standards at play that must be both assured and communicated well publicly.  ""We are pleased to see that the Privacy Commissioner has been consulted on the development of this app and that it will be voluntary in New Zealand. But further assurances are needed including that any data collected can only ever be used for the purposes of eliminating COVID-19 in New Zealand. Additionally, the data collection must be time-bound in relation to the pandemic and the data must not used for any commercial or other purposes that could be discriminatory. It’s essential the public is assured that private information is secure and collection efforts are subject to independent oversight.""  She adds New Zealand has an opportunity to show other countries ignoring these standards how a human rights-respecting response to eliminating COVID-19 can be accomplished.  ""New Zealand has an opportunity to do things differently from other countries that are breaching international human rights standards when it comes to tracking and using people’s personal information in a pandemic. We look forward to seeing details from the Government on how New Zealand can lead the way to ensuring all human rights are protected, for everyone.""   © Scoop Media"	NotNews
Palestinian-American Congressman Explains Why He Is Running for President  Justin Amash acknowledges there is 'no clear-cut answer' about whether he would take support from Trump or Biden, especially in closely contested places like his home state of Michigan  30 Apr 2020, 09:11 by The Associated Press  Rep. Justin Amash of Michigan said Wednesday he is seeking the Libertarian nod for president because millions of Americans do not feel well represented by either major political party and their standard-bearers: President Donald Trump and presumptive Democratic nominee Joe Biden.  Amash, whose father is a Palestinian Christian immigrant, has been a fierce Trump critic who left the Republican Party to become an independent and later supported his impeachment, told The Associated Press that too many people vote Republican or Democrat because they do not feel they have any other choice.  “It’s important that we present them with that alternative. ... The first step to moving toward no political parties or all independent candidates is to provide some big challengers to the main two parties right now,” he said. “The Libertarian Party can be that challenger.”  But third-party presidential campaigns can have unpredictable consequences. In 2000, Ralph Nader’s Green Party presidential bid cost Al Gore crucial support and was a contributing factor in George W. Bush’s eventual win. Hillary Clinton’s 2016 loss, meanwhile, has been blamed in part on the support Green Party candidate Jill Stein picked up in crucial battlegrounds such as Pennsylvania.  Amash was elected in 2010 as part of the tea party wave that toppled Democratic control. If Libertarians select him as their nominee at a national convention currently scheduled for May 21-25 in Texas, he would face nearly impossible odds of winning the presidency.  But Amash argued there is “no clear-cut answer” about whether he would take support from Trump or Biden, especially in closely contested places like his home state of Michigan. Trump narrowly won Michigan in 2016, by 10,704 votes, and Democrats are looking to take back the battleground state in 2020.  “There are millions of people who won’t vote for either one regardless,” Amash said. “I firmly believe that the positions I hold and the principles I espouse are ones that reflect a larger portion of the electorate than the number of people supporting either Donald Trump or Joe Biden.”  Related Articles • Erdogan sends Trump letter along with virus supplies; hopes Congress understands alliance • Biden says will keep U.S. Embassy in Jerusalem if elected • Palestinian-American congressman teases presidential run aimed at Trump  In Michigan, third-party candidates won 5% of the vote in 2016 — it was mostly Libertarian Gary Johnson — four years after they garnered less than 1%.  If he becomes the Libertarian nominee, Amash will be seeking the presidency at a time when the scope of the federal government is rapidly expanding to respond to the coronavirus. He said he supports a role for Washington to help people affected by the pandemic and the ravaged economy, but said the relief packages have helped the wealthy and well-connected more than the unemployed.  “They were left behind,” Amash said. “My campaign is really about representing those people. I really believe most Americans have fairly Libertarian views on things. They want government to work, and if government at any one level is doing too much or doing the wrong things, it’s not working very well.”  Rather than passing a $2 trillion rescue bill that backstopped certain industries, Amash said the government should have provided a monthly cash payment to all Americans.  “It still would have been cheaper than what the federal government is doing now, and it would have benefited way more people,” Amash said.  Amash, who became an independent last July, said he is running as a Libertarian because it is “very difficult to make headway” without a party apparatus.  Trump on Wednesday tweeted that Amash “would make a wonderful candidate, especially since he is way behind in his district and has no chance of maintaining his Congressional seat. He almost always votes for the Do Nothing Dems anyway. I like him even more than Jill Stein!”  Although Amash said he was confident he could have won reelection to a sixth term in Congress as an independent, he decided it would not have changed the “broken” political system enough.  “My heart is in running for president right now,” Amash said.

Raspberry Pi's improved camera module supports interchangeable lenses  30 Apr 2020, 08:41 by Steve Dent  Raspberry Pi has launched a new high-quality, interchangeable lens camera for budding photographers or folks who want to learn how tointegrate a camera into their build projects. It comes with a 7.9mm (Type 1/2.3) Sony IMX477 12.3-megapixel back-illuminated sensor, along with a mount that works with off the shelf C- and CS-mount lenses used on industrial and 16mm film cameras.     Dubbed the “High Quality Camera,” it’s a big step up from the Camera Module V2 from 2016. While it’s much less compact, the back-side illumination and much larger pixels will make it much more capable in low-light. It comes with a back-focus adjustment ring and tripod mount, and the larger format sensor is close to what you’d see on a compact camera, rather than a smartphone.  It doesn’t come with a lens, but Raspberry Pi resellers will be offering a 6mm CS-mount CCTV lens for $15, and a higher-quality 16mm C-mount model for $50. You can also get some pretty incredible new and used C-mount lenses at place like B&H Photo Video and eBay . If you want to go even farther, it’s easy to adapt a 16mm mount to a modern APS-C or even full-frame lens, as Raspberry Pi showed (hilariously) below. The Raspberry Pi High Quality Camera is now on sale for $50 , with a dust cap, C-CS adapter, tripod mount and ribbon cable to connect to a Raspberry Pi.	News
Cyber crooks abuse delivery services  30 Apr 2020, 08:21 by Staff Writer  Researchers at Kaspersky have discovered a series of spam and phishing attacks aimed at exploiting the Coronavirus pandemic by targeting users who are waiting for packages to be delivered.  Some of these criminals are posing as delivery service employees claiming that a package has arrived, and to receive it, the target must read or confirm the information in an attached file. Once the attachment is opened, however, malware is downloaded on their devices.  According to Kaspersky, one example of this is a backdoor called Remcos that when installed on a PC or a phone turns it into a bot, steals data, or downloads additional malware.  In another scam, bad actors have been creating legitimate looking phishing pages for popular delivery services as a way to get their hands on credentials. Potential targets are encouraged to input details such as their e-mail and password into the Web site in order to track their packages.  Tatyana Shcherbakova, senior Web content analyst at Kaspersky, says the COVID-19 pandemic has created chaos in industries across the board, including delivery services, so it's no big surprise that attackers would jump on the bandwagon.  “With people regularly receiving notifications about delivery delays or item shortages and without the option to purchase needed items in stores, these types of scams have a high chance of success,” she adds.  Although people are eager to receive their orders, she advises caution, adding that it’s important to always carefully assess where these e-mails are coming from and make sure the Web page address is correct.  Kaspersky experts urge users to never open attachments or click on links in e-mails from delivery services, particularly if the sender insists upon it. Going to the official Web site directly and loggin into an account from there is a more sensible option, they conclude.  Stuck at home? Time on your hands?  Read Brainstorm’s May edition for free.

"Former Arsenal boss Unai Emery open to Premier League return with rival club  30 Apr 2020, 08:28 by James Whaling, https://www.mirror.co.uk/authors/james-whaling/  Former Arsenal boss Unai Emery has refused to rule out a return to the Premier League.  Emery was relieved of his duties at the Emirates in November after a dismal run of form, culminating in a shock defeat by Eintracht Frankfurt in the Europa League.  He was linked with an immediate comeback to the English top flight with Everton , being interviewed for the Goodison role before Carlo Ancelotti took the reins.  Despite his struggles in north London, Emery insists he would be willing to have another crack at the Premier League, but admits his most likely route back into the dugout is in Spain.    Emery was sacked by Arsenal in November (Image: Arsenal FC via Getty Images)   “I am open to coaching,"" he told Eurosport’s ‘Confinados’ programme. “In Spain, in England, in Italy, in France, elsewhere… but if you ask me where I think I will be, I think I will be closer to the Spanish league.  “After four years if I have a good chance to return to Spain and I feel like it, I want to face it.  “The first objective is to return next season, but if I can’t find anything that fits what I hope for or reaches my heart, I will wait.  “Everton was interested in me and I thought about it. I didn’t say no, we also had a three-hour interview.”  Emery made history by winning three successive Europa League crowns with Sevilla between 2014 and 2016.  He then became manager of Paris Saint-Germain where he won the French title and four domestic cups.  But he failed to replicate those successes at Arsenal , losing to Chelsea in the final of the 2018-19 Europa League which denied the Gunners a spot at Europe's top table.

NHL, NHLPA not ready to abandon season   30 Apr 2020, 01:08   On the same day when White House COVID-19 expert Dr. Anthony Fauci said that some sports may have to abandon their seasons, the NHL announced that it is not ready to scrap the suspended 2019-20 campaign.  In addition, players might be able to start returning to team facilities as soon as mid-June, according to a joint statement issued Wednesday by the NHL and the NHL Players’ Association.  The statement began, “Despite numerous reports and speculation over the last several days, the NHL and the NHLPA have not made any decisions or set a timeline for possible return to play scenarios.”  The league and the players union added that they are turning their attention to moving from Phase 1 of the season’s shutdown, a self-quarantine period for players and hockey staff amid the coronavirus pandemic, to Phase 2, in which players could engage in “small group activities” at team facilities.  The statement added, “(Provided) that conditions continue to trend favorably — and, subject to potential competitive concerns as between disparately situated markets — we believe we may be able to move to Phase 2 at some point in the mid-to-later portion of May. Specific guidelines governing Player and Hockey Staff activity would be provided at that time. In the meantime, we expect Players and Hockey Staff to continue to adhere to the recommended guidelines put in place when the season was paused on March 12.”  Earlier Wednesday, Fauci told the New York Times, “I would love to be able to have all sports back. But as a health official and a physician and a scientist, I have to say, right now, when you look at the country, we’re not ready for that yet. ...  “Safety, for the players and for the fans, trumps everything. If you can’t guarantee safety, then unfortunately you’re going to have to bite the bullet and say, ‘We may have to go without this sport for this season.’”  If and when the NHL season resumes, it could have a very different look.  Commissioner Gary Bettman told Sportsnet last week that the play could resume with action in as few as two to four locations, with multiple teams sharing facilities. He added that the league is considering various scenarios regarding how the rest of the regular season and/or the postseason would be contested.  Games also might be played without fans.  “I think there will be some social distancing for a while,” Bettman said last week. “I think there will be masks. There will be Purell. There will be lots of things, but that’s something that ultimately the medical people and the government leaders will be the best able to tell us.”  When the NHL season was halted, all teams had played between 68 and 71 of their scheduled 82 regular-season games. The regular season was originally set to end on April 4.  Eight NHL players are known to have tested positive for COVID-19: five members of the Ottawa Senators and three members of the Colorado Avalanche.  —Field Level Media	News
"UST-Legazpi grad leads 2,103 bar passers; UP, Ateneo fail top 10  30 Apr 2020, 01:50 by Rey E. Requejo  A law graduate from the University of Santo Tomas-Legazpi City topped the 2019 Bar Exams with a rating of 91.0490 percent.     Mae Diane Azores of UST Legazpi—formerly of Aquinas University—received the highest rating among the 2,103 candidates who passed the exams last year, the Supreme Court announced. The result stunned the legal community following the failure of the Bar takers from the University of the Philippines and the Ateneo Law School to make it to the top. None of the law graduates from the UP-College of Law and the Ateneo Law School made it to the top 10 last year. The examinees who also obtained the highest ratings were Princess Fatima Parahiman, a graduate of the University of the East who placed second with 89.5230 percent, and Myra Baranda, also of UST-Legazpi, who landed third with a score of 88.8250 percent. In fourth place was Dawna Fya Bandiola of San Beda College Alabang with 88.3360 percent, while Jocelyn Fabello of Palawan State University took fifth with 88.2630 percent. With a rating of 88.173 percent, Kenneth Glenn Manuel of the University of Santo Tomas placed sixth, while Rhowee Buergo of Jose Rizal University landed seventh with 87.8710 percent. Anton Luis Avila of Saint Louis University took eighth place with 87.5820 percent, followed by Jun Dexter Rojas of Polytechnic University of the Philippines with 87.5765 percent and Bebelan Madera of the University of St. La Salle with 87.3795 percent, the two who landed ninth and 10th, respectively. READ: 7 women in top 10 of Bar Exam: 2,103 new lawyers  2020 Bar Exams postponed The Supreme Court said Wednesday it decided to postpone the 2020 Bar Examinations due to the ""social and economic disruption"" of the COVID-19 pandemic. Associate Justice Marvic Leonen said the new schedule of the test will be announced in June, adding it would ""definitely be held"" next year. “This is to give the court ample time to determine the necessary adjustments and to make adequate preparations for the safe and orderly conduct of the examinations,"" he said. Leonen said the high court also approved his proposal for the exams to be held in Manila and in Cebu. The Bar exams were usually held at the University of Santo Tomas in Manila during four Sundays of November. ‘Always dream bigger’ No dream is ever too big for Mae Diane Azores, who studied for 10 to 12 hours straight to pass the 2019 Bar Exams. Azores, a graduate of the University of Santo Tomas-Legazpi, said she disconnected from social media and prayed the rosary before the release of the exam results. When she returned online, Azores found she led the 2,103 passers. The certified public accountant, who works as a state auditor, had gotten a score of 91.049 percent. ""No dream is ever big, especially for provincial schools. If we really put our minds to it, we can do it. Just trust God and pray,” Azores told ABS-CBN News. In an interview with DZMM radio, Azores said she woke up at 4 a.m. and studied for 10 to 12 hours straight to prepare for the tough exams. ""Before the review began, there were some who said I could be a topnotcher, so I should do a good job. I used that pressure as a motivation, thinking I could achieve it,” Azores said. Flunker places fourth A law graduate who failed the Bar Exams in 2018 placed fourth in her second try last year-an achievement she attributed Wednesday to a divine plan and to right timing. Dawna Fya Bandiola of San Beda College-Alabang said when she flunked the exams on her first try, she told herself, ""Perhaps it was not yet the right time. It was not yet in the Lord's will to give me what I was praying for. “You won't be given everything you want when you want it. There are times you need to experience rejection so you can give more importance to the things you disregard.” Bandiola scored 88.336 percent on her second try in the Bar Exams last November, landing her in fourth place. “I just thought that it was about timing. I just left everything to the Lord, let Him take care of everything,” Bandiola said.

Postal workers plan drive-by salute to hospital employees  30 Apr 2020, 06:00 by Jeff Bell  Greater Victoria postal workers will be saluting health-care staff Thursday night by driving post office vehicles past Royal Jubilee and Victoria General hospitals.  Fire trucks will be providing an escort.  Postal workers will divide into two groups, with those from the Glanford Avenue depot going to Royal Jubilee and those from the Station Avenue depot going to Victoria General.  Participants will be completing their routes for the day before heading to the two facilities to get vehicles, said Jessica Dempster, president of Canadian Union of Postal Workers Local 850.  “It’s kind of a way to really show our appreciation for those workers, all the workers in the hospitals — all of them, the doctors, the nurses, the cleaners, everyone that’s going in there every day,” she said.  Dempster said the response from postal workers has been “pretty overwhelming.”  The plan is for the Royal Jubilee group to meet at the Save-on-Foods at Fort Street and Foul Bay Road and the Victoria General to muster on Hospital Way, both from 6:30 to 6:45 p.m.  That puts them at the hospitals in time for the nightly public noise-making at 7 p.m. for front-line workers. If time allows, the postal workers will also visit some grocery stores, Dempster said.	News
Lessons learned from COVID-19 outbreak at West Kelowna nursery help protect residents, farm workers  30 Apr 2020, 23:55 by Rob Munro     Image Credit: (Bob Brawdy/The Tri-City Herald via AP, File)    As thousands of temporary foreign workers start trickling into the Okanagan, residents and the workers should feel comfortable that it won’t result in an increase in COVID-19 cases.  That’s the gist of what B.C.'s provincial health officer Dr. Bonnie Henry said in answer to a question during her daily COVID-19 update today, April 30.  There was an outbreak of COVID-19 amongst a group of Mexican workers in March at Bylands Nurseries in West Kelowna where 23 of 63 workers tested positive due, in part, to a second small outbreak after the first 14-day incubation period.  They arrived before international travel was banned and since they were living in a communal setting the disease spread.  “It was the outbreak that we experienced in the Okanagan that really made us recognize that people in communal settings, like they were — even though they were very good accommodations — it was very challenging for the workers in those settings to isolate from each other once the outbreak gets started,” Henry said.  The incoming foreign workers are not living communally.  “What we have done is put them up separately so they are not having contact with each other,” Henry said. “They are being provided for in a hotel accommodation so they all have their own bathroom, their own room, they're provided food, they’re provided with means to have contact, they have outside time. But we maintain the physical distancing. We maintain the hygiene that's necessary.”  Four of the incoming workers, on four different flights, did test positive for COVID-19.  They were moved to a separate area in the hotel so there was no way they could have contact with any other workers, Henry said.  Because of that, the other workers have been cleared to travel to the farms where they are going to work this summer.  The workers are checked for COVID-19 in their home countries and, again, by Canadian officials when they arrive, Ministry of Health spokesperson Chris Shewchuk said in an email. If they show symptoms they are quarantined immediately and tested.  Those not showing symptoms are screened on arrival, checked during their stay and screened again before being cleared to leave.  Those who have symptoms and test positive must be cleared by a health care provider before being allowed to travel, Shewchuk wrote.

Master Official Trailer Finally Gets A Release Date?  30 Apr 2020, 23:16 by Akhila R Menon  The Tamil cinema audiences have been eagerly waiting for the official trailer of Master , the upcoming Thalapathy Vijay project, ever since the audio of the project was launched. The Master trailer, which was supposed to be released in March 2020, was postponed due to the all India lockdown. Reportedly, the trailer of the Vijay starrer has finally got a release date.  If the latest reports are to be believed, the makers are planning to release the Master trailer on May 3, Sunday. But, if things didn't go as planned, the makers might postpone the trailer release of the Lokesh Kanagaraj directorial to May 10, 2020. An official confirmation on the same is expected to be made very soon.  Master trailer is expected to break all the pre-existing records of the Tamil film industry, considering the huge hype surrounding the Thalapathy Vijay starrer. Even if the trailer is released in May 2020, the action-thriller might not hit the theaters anytime soon, due to the coronavirus threat.     According to the rumour mills, popular OTT platform Amazon Prime has bagged the online streaming rights of Master for a record price. But both the makers of the project and Amazon Prime representatives have not made an official announcement on the same, yet.  Interestingly, Master is all set to emerge as the first multi-lingual pan-Indian film of its lead actor Vijay's career. If the reports are to be believed, the action thriller will be simultaneously released in Tamil, Telugu, Malayalam, Kannada, and Hindi languages.  Vijay Sethupathi, the Makkal Selvan of Tamil cinema will appear as the main antagonist in the movie, which features Petta fame Malavika Mohanan as the female lead.

"Newly engaged lesbian couple missing in North Carolina  30 Apr 2020, 15:13 by Tim Fitzsimons  A newly engaged couple, Stephanie Mayorga, 27, and Paige Escalera, 25, disappeared in mid-April under ""suspicious"" circumstances, the police in Wilmington, North Carolina, said Wednesday at a news conference.  Their roommate filed a missing persons report several days after the women were last seen on April 15.  Capt. Thomas Tillman said surveillance footage showed the couple leaving their Wilmington home and driving a gray 2013 Dodge Dart with two stickers on the back windshield and South Carolina plates.  Tillman described the disappearance as ""suspicious"" based on undisclosed information received in the past week.  He said detectives had spoken to family members, friends and coworkers of both missing women ""in an attempt to gather information of where they might have gone and where they went missing.""  Tillman said the coronavirus pandemic is partly to blame for the more than two-week delay between the couple's disappearance and the news conference.  ""Life is not going on at the Wilmington Police Department as simply as it did before the COVID-19 pandemic,"" he said.  NBC OUT  In an interview with Oxygen , Stevie Jenkins, Escalera's sister, said that Escalera and Mayorga had only recently met and had moved in together at the beginning of March.  Jenkins also said that close friends of her sister had been blocked from her social media over the last week or two. ""It is normal for family to not hear from her, but not her closest friends,"" Jenkins told Oxygen.     Follow NBC Out on Twitter , Facebook & Instagram"	News
"Clinging to life in a Paris intensive care unit  30 Apr 2020, 15:10 by Daphne ROUSSEAU (AFP)  Two hospital rooms, next to each other but separated by fate: In one, a COVID-19 patient still unconscious and weakening after five weeks of round-the-clock care. In the other, a man has just woken up, unsure where he is or what happened to his body, but saved.  Electrodes cover the awakened 60-year-old's sunken chest, and his face is a mosaic of red lesions after having a tube inserted into his windpipe to keep him breathing during three weeks in an artificial coma.  His eyes bulge with panic, but eventually they lock with those of a physiotherapist who has put on jazz music to cover the staccato of monitors and alarms at the intensive care unit of the sprawling Lariboisiere hospital in northern Paris.  The French word for the service, ""reanimation,"" more clearly evokes what is at stake for the doctors and nurses fighting a virus whose devastating effects are still not fully understood.    A nurse looks at Corinne B., a 50-year-old recovering from COVID-19 at Lariboisiere JOEL SAGET, AFP   ""Reanimation is a very aggressive treatment, which is why we have to perform it with as much humanity as possible,"" Benjamin Chousterman, an ICU doctor at Lariboisiere, told AFP during a rare inside look at the fight to keep coronavirus victims alive.  ""We have entered a phase where we have managed to save some of them, to allow them to leave intensive care, but there are still some patients who remain in extremely critical condition and who might not be able to leave,"" he said.  The service has about 60 beds, half of them brought in just a few weeks ago as it became clear hospitals were being overwhelmed in areas where the virus was spreading fast.  France had just 5,000 intensive care beds nationwide when the crisis hit, and officials have scrambled to set up thousands more since the first coronavirus infection was reported in the country in January.  As of Wednesday, about 4,200 COVID-19 patients were in intensive care nationwide, a number that has fallen steadily over the past three weeks from a peak of over 7,000 at the beginning of April.  The national total death toll has surpassed 24,000.  Health experts fear that an easing of lockdown orders from May 11 could spark a new flare-up in cases, since only a small fraction of the French population has been exposed to the virus.  - Baptism of fire -  At the other end of the corridor lies the COVID-19 patient who has been at Lariboisiere the longest -- six weeks in a coma.  Doctors are preparing the risky manoeuvre of trying to turn him onto his stomach. It is the fifth attempt and one of the last options for opening up respiratory passages when the lungs, constricted by inflammation, are not responding to other treatments.    The Lariboisiere hospital in Paris had to double its number of intensive care beds to 60 in just a matter of days as the extent of the coronavirus crisis became clear. JOEL SAGET, AFP   But it is the first attempt for Luisa Oliveira, a nurse new to the service.  Rachel Ohanian, the colleague overseeing Oliveira's crash course, doesn't mince words: ""These first two days are really going to do a number on you.""  The instructions come quick -- keep all the catheters in place, untangle all the tubes and above all, make sure the blood oxygen and pulse monitor attached to his finger stays in place so the team can know whether the procedure is working or not.  They manage, but doctors are not optimistic. If there is no improvement soon, the next step will be to attach the man to a machine to start pumping blood artificially and injecting oxygen. But that is only a short-term solution.  - 'Survived the storm' -  ""As with most infectious diseases like COVID-19, we don't have a cure, so the only thing you can do is keep organs functioning,"" Samuel Gaugain, a fellow ICU doctor at Lariboisiere, says after tending to another patient.  ""He is 33 and hardly has any underlying conditions, only a little asthma, but he has a very severe case and has been in an incredibly serious condition for three weeks,"" Gaugain says of the third patient.  ""He has lost 10 kilogrammes (22 pounds) of muscle mass but has taken on 10 kilos of fluid because of swelling.""    A patient infected with COVID-19 lies on a medical bed at the intensive care unit of the Lariboisiere Hospital in Paris JOEL SAGET, AFP   Doctors have put the patient on tranquilisers to assuage the powerful nightmares and delirium that are common during long periods of intensive care, caught between waking and sleep and punctuated only by dozens of exams and tests.  Today the man's caretakers try slightly reducing the power of his ventilator machine to see if his lungs have regained capacity to function on their own.  But his blood oxygen levels plunge and the young man's eyes nearly burst out of their sockets in fear -- he is on the verge of respiratory failure.  ""Don't worry, your diaphragm is still all worn out,"" Gaugain tells him, laying a hand on his arm. ""You're young, you're tired, but it will come back. You've survived the storm.""  The patient looks up but soon looks away, his face the image of despair.  - 'Surprised to be alive' -  Corinne, 50, runs a health and social services agency for the handicapped.  She is now recovering at Lariboisiere after she too came down with the new coronavirus.    The number of intensive care patients in France is now around 4,200, from a peak of over 7,000 at the beginning of April JOEL SAGET, AFP   ""In the ICU, I felt like I was being crushed, with all sorts of injections, because I had an intubation, they put in catheters, and each person who comes in opens the bandage in his or her own way,"" she says.  ""I was very surprised to still be alive, because when I was told what happened -- I actually thought that I was already dead and that they had managed to bring me back to life.""  Since her ordeal, Corinne has savoured each sip of water, the thing she dreamed of while still in the throes of COVID-19.  ""The hard thing is to have lost my autonomy, to see myself like this. When you've been working with disabled people for 20 years, it's a strange feeling,"" she says."	NotNews
"Dow Jones slips after grim jobless claims data  The Dow Jones Industrial Average was down 216.97 points, or 0.88 per cent, at 24,416.89.  30 Apr 2020, 15:13 by Reuters    The S&P 500 was down 18.52 points, or 0.63 per cent, at 2,920.99. AFP   The S&P 500 and Dow Jones indexes dipped on Thursday as a grim US jobless claims report took the shine off a strong month for stock markets globally, but encouraging quarterly earnings reports from Facebook and Tesla supported the Nasdaq.  Nine of the 11 major S&P 500 sectors were trading lower, but declines were led by the defensive real estate, utilities and consumer staples indexes, suggesting the mood was still risk-on.  Dramatic US monetary and fiscal stimulus and hopes of a revival in business activity as states reopen from lockdowns have powered a Wall Street rally in April, putting the benchmark S&P 500 on course for its best month since 1974.  But analysts have warned of another selloff as economic data underlines the extent of the damage already done, with investors also wary of the pace of the recovery from a looming recession.  On Thursday, the Labor Department's report showed initial unemployment claims totaled 3.84 million for the week ended April 25, a day after data confirmed the biggest contraction for the US economy in the first quarter since the Great Recession.  ""In large part this data is seen as something we've already taken for granted,"" said Art Hogan, chief market strategist at National Securities in New York.  ""We know that the economic data, especially as it pertains to labor, is bad and is going to get worse.""  The Federal Reserve pledged on Wednesday to expand emergency programs to revive growth but dashed hopes for a fast rebound, saying the economy could feel the weight of consumer fear and social distancing for a year.  At 10:21 a.m. ET the Dow Jones Industrial Average was down 216.97 points, or 0.88 per cent, at 24,416.89 and the S&P 500 was down 18.52 points, or 0.63 per cent, at 2,920.99.  The Nasdaq Composite, however, was down 3.74 points, or nearly flat, at 8,910.97, cushioned by a 5.9 per cent jump for Facebook Inc after the social media giant posted better-than-expected quarterly revenue.  The pandemic has been less disruptive to tech-related stocks, with Facebook, Apple Inc, Amazon.com Inc , Netflix Inc and Alphabet Inc - the so-called FAANG group of stocks - gaining between 12 per cent and 25 per cent this month.  ""The SPX price action during this crisis has been led by a handful of 'haves' (mostly the FAANGs) in a world in which most companies are 'have nots',"" said Nancy Davis, founder of asset management firm Quadratic Capital Management in Greenwich, Connecticut.  The two remaining FAANG stocks - Apple Inc and Amazon.com - will report results after markets close.  Electric car maker Tesla Inc climbed 5.5 per cent after posting its third straight quarterly profit, taking investors by surprise as its automaker peers were hit by a slump in consumer demand and factory shutdowns.  McDonald's Corp shed 2.5 per cent after it reported a 16.7 per cent slide in quarterly profit as most of its restaurants across the globe limited their services to deliveries and take-aways.  American Airlines fell 3.4 per cent as the airline operator posted its first quarterly loss since emerging from bankruptcy in 2013 and warned of a $70 million a day cash burn."	News
Roughly 110,000 complete preemployment card courses, entitling them to cash assistance  30 Apr 2020, 15:26 by Dzulfiqar Fathur Rahman  Around 110,000 eligible recipients of the preemployment card, a government-funded unemployment benefit and skill training program, have completed their courses, entitling them to receive cash assistance, an official has said.  The program management’s executive director, Denni Purbasari, said in Jakarta Wednesday that some of the most popular courses were on English, online business, barista skills, coffee shop management, interviewing and spreadsheet application Microsoft Excel. Such courses cost between Rp 24,000 (US$1.57) and more than Rp 1 million.  As many as 223 training institutions are involved in the program, providing more than 2,000 courses on various subjects through eight online learning platforms, including Skill Academy, Bukalapak, Tokopedia and Sisnaker. Denni said her office planned to team up with more training institutions to “provide as many options as possible to the 5.6 million recipients”.  As of Tuesday, more than 8.6 million applicants had registered to receive Rp 3.55 million in benefits . “We want the people who receive the preemployment card to not just be employees, but also entrepreneurs,” Denni, who formerly served as the President’s economic policy advisor, said in an online briefing on Wednesday.  The government launched the program on April 11, earlier than the initial schedule in November, to assist people laid off or furloughed because of the economic impacts of the COVID-19 outbreak, which had infected more than 9,500 people nationwide, as of Wednesday. The program is also aimed at helping owners of small businesses who have lost customers.  As many as 2.2 million people have lost their jobs because of the economic downturn, according to Manpower Ministry data last updated on April 20. More than half are formal sector workers furloughed by 43,690 firms.  Executive director of the Institute of Development for Economics and Finance (INDEF) Tauhid Ahmad said Wednesday the program should offer courses on skills related to the government’s priority industries, such as tourism, in line with the 2020–2024 National Medium-Term Development Plan (RPJMN).  Many of the more than 20,000 recipients who have taken courses via Sisnaker, an online learning platform managed by the Manpower Ministry, have studied information technology.  “The recipients might not know the needs in the labor market,” Tauhid said during the same online briefing, adding that the program management should evaluate the relevance of available courses.  However, with most nonessential businesses shutting down their operations, laid-off and furloughed workers needed cash assistance more than access to subsidized online courses, said Center of Reform on Economics (CORE) Indonesia research director Piter Abdullah.  If eligible, the participants will each receive cash and training benefits worth Rp 3.55 million.  Of this, Rp 2.4 million will be disbursed as cash assistance over the course of four months after a recipient has completed a course. A further Rp 1 million is for training costs and the remaining Rp 150,000 is received for completing a survey.  “I have seen myself that laid-off workers are not able to pay their mortgages or rent,” Piter said during the same online briefing. “If they continue living under such conditions, they will be forced to move out.”  With increasing numbers of people out of work, many are struggling to even purchase food. Out of 500 households surveyed across the country, 35 percent reported a decrease in food consumption, said National Development Planning Agency deputy head of population and employment Pungky Sumadi, quoting a recent survey by J-PAL Southeast Asia.  “Therefore, we have to adjust the framework of our social safety net programs to the people’s current needs,” Pungky said in a separate online briefing on Wednesday. “The changing framework also applies to the preemployment card program.”  The government hoped the program could provide data on those vulnerable to falling into poverty, said program management chairman Rudy Salahuddin.  With other social safety net programs such as the Family Hope Program and the staple food card, the government has collected data on the poorest 40 percent of the population.  “This data is useful if we want to expand other social assistance programs in the future,” Rudy said during an online briefing Wednesday.

Premier League wrestles with ‘Project Restart’   30 Apr 2020, 15:01   LONDON, April 30 — Premier League clubs will meet tomorrow to discuss whether it is realistic to complete the season during the coronavirus crisis or whether they will have to brace for a devastating financial hit.  The Dutch season has already been called off, Belgium looks set to go the same way and French clubs met today to decide whether to declare their season over.  But with the English top-flight facing an eye-watering estimated loss of £1 billion (US$1.25 billion) if no more football is played, there is a huge incentive to play the 92 remaining games if feasible.  The Premier League also appears to have the support of the government in Britain, which now has the third-highest death toll in the world from Covid-19.  Speaking in parliament last week, Oliver Dowden, Britain’s Digital, Culture, Media and Sport Secretary, said he had been in talks with league chiefs over getting football up and running again.  Liverpool fans will be the keenest for the season to restart, with Jurgen Klopp’s side on the brink of their first league title for 30 years when matches were suspended in March.  AFP Sport looks at the issues the Premier League is facing:   Testing   Testing has been a thorny political issue during the pandemic in Britain, with many frontline workers unable to access tests until recently.  Although capacity has been ramped up as the government raced to meet a target of 100,000 tests a day by the end of April, there is still unease at the prospect of young, healthy footballers being regularly tested when other members of society are not.  Players and officials could be tested up to twice a week, according to a Sky Sports report today.  “Are we sending the right message to society? Does it encourage a healthy return or does it maybe send a bad signal suggesting football has different rules than the rest of the world,” said Jonas Baer-Hoffmann, general secretary of players’ union FIFPro.  The Premier League can ill afford another PR disaster in the midst of the crisis after several stumbles so far.  Liverpool, Tottenham and Bournemouth have backtracked on their plans to use government money to prop up the wages of non-playing staff due to public pressure.  And the issue of whether players should take a pay cut has rumbled on.   Player welfare   Former England captain Wayne Rooney complained players had been treated like “guinea pigs” in the days before football was shut down.  The push to suspend the season only gathered pace when Arsenal manager Mikel Arteta and Chelsea winger Callum Hudson-Odoi tested positive, demonstrating that even those in a relatively protected bubble were at risk.  “We have reiterated that players are not just footballers but partners, fathers, mothers, sons and daughters who share the same health concerns as everyone else during this pandemic,” said Bobby Barnes, deputy chief executive of the Professional Footballers’ Association.  Former Manchester United captain Gary Neville, who owns a stake in League Two side Salford City, went even further when he asked: “How many people have to die playing football in the Premier League before it becomes unpalatable?”  Neville is one of many who believe economic angst is overriding the necessity for players to return to a safe environment while Baer-Hoffmann said putting pressure on players to come back could add to their anxiety.  On top of the risk to their health, players would potentially face the mental toil of weeks away from their families, quarantined in hotels.   Where would games be played?   If matches are to return, it is most likely they will do so in a small number of venues across the country behind closed doors to minimise the number of ambulance, police, security and broadcast personnel needed.  However, there are fears that fans could still congregate near stadiums either during matches or to celebrate major triumphs.  Liverpool, 25 points ahead of reigning champions Manchester City at the top, are potentially two games away from wrapping up the title  “Even if it was behind closed doors, there’d be many thousands of people who would turn up outside Anfield,” Liverpool mayor Joe Anderson told the BBC.  “There’s not many people who would respect what we were saying and stay away from the ground. A lot of people would come to celebrate so I think it’s a non-starter.” — AFP   Related Articles	NotNews
Knoxville announces cancellation of Festival on the 4th event   30 Apr 2020, 15:44     Festival on the Fourth canceled   KNOXVILLE, Tenn. (WVLT) - The City of Knoxville announced Thursday morning the cancellation of this year’s Festival on the 4th celebration due to ongoing concerns related to the COVID-19 pandemic.     The annual event draws thousands to the World’s Fair Park grounds every year to enjoy family-fun activities, the sounds of the Knoxville Symphony Orchestra, and to revel in the fireworks put on by Pyro Shows of LaFollette, TN.  Mayor Kincannon said, “We are an incredibly patriotic city and this is an annual event we look forward to every summer. However, under the circumstances gatherings of this size should not take place and would put our residents at a greater risk for spreading COVID-19. We can still celebrate our country’s independence while keeping health top of mind.”  Knoxville is working on details surrounding a “modified celebration of July 4th” including a neighborhood challenge that will keep the spirit of the holiday alive and provide a sense of togetherness, while making the health and safety of our residents a top priority.

"Liverpool FC warned over Timo Werner transfer amid Manchester United links  Former Liverpool player Didi Hamann has suggested Timo Werner's influence could decrease if he moves to Anfield.  30 Apr 2020, 15:00 by Josh Challies, https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/authors/josh-challies/, Jamie Kemble  Former Liverpool midfielder Didi Hamann said Timo Werner might not be as effective for Liverpool as he is for RB Leipzig.  Werner has been linked with a move to Liverpool and is under consideration by Manchester United as they use data analytics in their search for a new striker.  It has been reported by German outlet Bild that Werner has decided he wants to join Liverpool but Hamann has warned both parties against a move.  “I’m not too sure. They said today in the papers that he doesn’t want to go to Bayern Munich, he’s always expressed how fond he is of Jurgen Klopp, that he maybe wants to join them, but the thing is with Liverpool, you have probably got the best front three in world football,"" he told Sky Sports' Football Show.  “If you play out wide in Liverpool, even though the full-backs like to go on the overlap, Salah and Mane are both very tricky players, they’re very skilful and Timo Werner is not that type of player.  ""His biggest asset by far is his pace.  “If I watch games now, even at Anfield with Liverpool being so superior to most teams, all the teams sit back and if you deny Werner space, I think he is a lot less effective.  ""His goal record this season is outstanding but they like to play on the counter-attack and they’re not really a possession team.  “I don’t think he has the trickery to play out wide and then if you look at Firmino’s position, I think the way they are set-up you need a player like Firmino is who links things up, he’s not one to go behind the back four, he likes to come short and bring the likes of Mane into play.  “I just wouldn’t know where to play Werner.  ""I don’t think he’s a wide player, he is a player who is best through the middle, and I just wouldn’t know where he should play.  ""On the other hand, it’s the Africa Cup of Nations, so Mane and Salah will have to go away, maybe that’s one thing that Liverpool have got in the back of their minds.  “I’m sure there are players out there who might help Liverpool next season more than Timo Werner.”  United have far less competition when it comes to a lead striker, particularly if loanee Odion Ighalo returns to parent club Shanghai Greenland Shenhua.  It's understood centre-forward is one of three positions they will look to strengthen in the summer, as they also look to strengthen on the right wing and in central midfield."	News
Russia Slams US Arguments for Low-Yield Nukes  30 Apr 2020, 12:40 by ASSOCIATED PRESS   Russia says President Trump’s plans to field ‘low-yield’ nuclear weapons will restart a dangerous arms race.      MOSCOW (AP) — The Russian Foreign Ministry on Wednesday rejected U.S. arguments for fielding low-yield nuclear warheads, warning that an attempt to use such weapons against Russia would trigger an all-out nuclear retaliation.  The U.S. State Department said in a paper released last week that fitting the low-yield nuclear warheads to submarine-launched ballistic missiles would help counter potential new threats from Russia and China. It charged that Moscow in particular was pondering the use of nonstrategic nuclear weapons as a way of coercion in a limited conflict — an assertion that Russia has repeatedly denied.  The State Department said that the new supplemental warhead “reduces the risk of nuclear war by reinforcing extended deterrence and assurance.”  The Russian Foreign Ministry sees it otherwise.  Ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova commented on the State Department’s paper at a briefing Wednesday, saying the United States should not view its new low-yield warheads as a flexible tool that could help avert an all-out nuclear conflict with Russia.  “Any attack involving a U.S. submarine-launched ballistic missile, regardless of its weapon specifications, would be perceived as a nuclear aggression,” Zakharova said. “Those who like to theorize about the flexibility of American nuclear potential must understand that in line with the Russian military doctrine such actions are seen as warranting retaliatory use of nuclear weapons by Russia.”  Zakharova cast the U.S. deployment of low-yield warheads as a destabilizing move that would result in “lowering the nuclear threshold.”  U.S.-Russian differences on nuclear arms issues come as relations between Moscow and Washington are at post-Cold War lows over the Ukrainian crisis and accusations of Russian meddling in the U.S. 2016 presidential election.  Last year both Moscow and Washington withdrew from the 1987 Intermediate-range Nuclear Forces Treaty.  The only U.S.-Russian nuclear arms control agreement still standing is the New START treaty, which was signed in 2010 by President Barack Obama and then-Russian President Dmitry Medvedev. The pact limits each country to no more than 1,550 deployed nuclear warheads and 700 deployed missiles and bombers and envisages sweeping on-site inspections to verify the compliance.  Russia has offered to extend the New START that expires in February 2021, while the Trump administration has pushed for a new arms control pact that would include China. Moscow has described that idea as unfeasible, citing Beijing’s refusal to negotiate any deal that would reduce its much smaller nuclear arsenal.  In a statement Wednesday marking the 10 th anniversary of signing the New START, the Russian Foreign Ministry hailed the treaty as an instrument that helps ensure predictability in the nuclear sphere and reaffirmed Moscow’s offer to extend it without preconditions.

Le tout, en jouant une partition de chanteuse d’opéra avec les notes aiguës si caractéristiques des blocs italiens dans les hauts régimes. Comme sur la F40, toute la puissance est transmise aux deux énormes roues arrière, qui mesurent ici 335 mm de large (seulement 245 mm de large à l’avant), via une boîte manuelle 6 rapports virile et sa fameuse grille en “H”, typiquement Ferrari.

"Gaming Laptops Aren't Just For Gamers Anymore  30 Apr 2020, 12:15 by Matt Hopkins    Image: GIGABYTE.   The first generation of gaming laptops were, in a word, excessive. While they packed the computing power necessary to game on the go, they were often big, bulky, noisy and sported obnoxious, gaudy design. In other words, they'd look pretty out of place in a boardroom meeting.  This article is sponsored by GIGABYTE .  Any computer powerful enough to run new release video games on high settings is powerful enough to do almost anything you can throw at it, from graphic design to photo or video editing. Having that kind of portable power without needing to lug around something that looks and sounds like a spaceship taking off used to be a fairly big ask. That kind of power can now be crammed into a relatively slim frame.  With a new wave of sleek, powerful gaming laptops emerging, it's fair to say these portable rigs aren't just for gamers anymore. Here are a few reasons why.  They've grown up  Unlike the clunky machines of yore, newer gaming laptops are embracing subtlety in more ways than one. Most are quieter, slimmer, lighter and unassuming in design when compared to their hefty predecessors. To become a viable solution outside of the gaming world, these are evolutions that needed to happen.    A 2006 Alienware gaming laptop compared to the new GIGABYTE AERO 15. Top image: notebookreview.com.   Thomas Vernier, Systems Administrator for a Sydney-based tech company, opted for a gaming laptop for peace of mind, knowing that it would be powerful enough to handle everything from regular use to more complex programs required for his work. While a preference for the Windows operating system was one reason he didn't choose a Mac, aesthetic was also an important consideration and something that's no longer exclusive to Apple.  ""They're similar in performance and also tick the box of a good-looking laptop,"" he told Gizmodo Australia.  Mackenzie Rowles is the owner of the Camelworks YouTube channel and uses a gaming laptop to create content.  ""Gaming laptops are good for anyone that needs a high-spec laptop,"" he told Gizmodo Australia. ""I use mine for video editing while travelling and find gaming-specific units far better than Macs, which are overpriced and limited in terms of what they offer.""  GIGABYTE's new AERO 15 OLED laptop is a good example of gaming power in a chassis you wouldn't be embarrassed taking into a business meeting.  The top of the line model comes packed with NVIDIA® GeForce RTX™ 2080 Super - one of the most powerful graphics processors available right now - along with an Intel Core i9-10980HK CPU and up to 64GB of RAM. Considering this is as powerful as a topline desktop gaming PC, it's impressive to see it fit into a 356(W) x 250(D) x 20(H) mm body weighing around 2kg. For comparison, many gaming laptops nudge closer to 3kgs.     All that power requires strong cooling, which often comes at the price of noisy internal fans. According to Linus Tech Tips , the AERO 15 OLED is capable of running graphics-heavy AAA games while maintaining ""very reasonable noise level,"" and that's when it's being pushed hard.  The AERO is also the world's first AI laptop, utilising Microsoft's Azure Machine Learning platform to ""automatically and dynamically adjust the best CPU and GPU wattage setting for different apps"". In other words, it fiddles around with settings for you to ensure you're always getting the most efficient use of power based on what you're doing.  It's nice to have the option  While a gaming laptop might be considered overkill for any work that doesn't require intense graphic or video processing, for many people, it provides entertainment and creative options on top a stable work tool.  Never underestimate how useful a fast computer can be in any industry. Even if it's just tapping away at a spreadsheet, a fast processor and plenty of RAM will ensure you never get bogged down and leave plenty of overhead for other apps, browsers and anything else you need to run at the same time.  Gamers will obviously see the advantages of having a work laptop capable of a quick lunchtime gaming session, but they're also useful for those with hobbies involving content creation, design, photo/video editing or even music production via processor and RAM-hungry digital audio workstations (DAWs) like Ableton Live.  When tested with Photoshop, as an example, the AERO clocked in at 18% faster than its competitors.     Gaming laptops can tick more than just one box now, which is the case for electrical engineer, Martin Cloughley.  ""I use a gaming laptop to run LED installations for shows I play as a DJ,"" he told Gizmodo Australia. ""I use it to game in my downtime as well, so it kills two birds with one stone when it comes to my hobbies.""  They'll likely last longer  Going with a top of the line gaming laptop can almost be seen as an investment, as they're far less likely to be superseded in the short term. This is because they use high-quality parts that are built to handle the demands of gaming and are usually able to keep up with future releases for quite a while, even at high graphics settings.  According to NetBookNews , a gaming laptop can last 5 to 6 years without maintenance. In terms of what to look for in a gaming laptop right now, RTX graphics cards, while expensive, will keep you in good stead moving forward.  ""Going with an RTX system will future proof your purchase, ensuring your gaming laptop will continue to run any game on ultra settings for years and years to come,"" the site says.  Whether you're a gamer or just appreciate the productivity boost a lightning-fast laptop provides, a gaming laptop is a choice worth considering.

Mental health providers struggle to adapt during COVID-19  30 Apr 2020, 12:24 by Patti Verbanas-Rutgers  A survey of community-based mental health providers highlights the adaptions they’re making to continue service.  Some community-based mental health providers in New Jersey don’t have the necessary funds for the telehealth technology they need to reach patients or the personal protective equipment (PPE) required to protect staff, according to the survey.  Mental health providers—who work primarily in outpatient department day programs, through mobile outreach services, or through face-to-face services in residences and settings inside and outside hospitals—from more than 40 community-based mental health organizations responded to the survey.  The survey is a sampling of 140 provider organizations that serve more than 90,000 people with serious mental health conditions, most of whom are unemployed and impoverished and some of whom are homeless or homebound.  Here, Ken Gill, associate dean and chair in the psychiatric rehabilitation and counseling department at the Rutgers School of Health Professions, explains the findings.    Q : What were the major challenges reported?   A : The organizations reported dozens of adaptations that they made or plan to make to deliver telehealth , with varying degrees of success due to limits in their organizational infrastructure, existing technology, and an inability to move staff to more in-demand services due to lack of expertise in those areas.However, they note they are ramping up as quickly as possible. Other adaptations include obtaining PPE from alternate sources, providing the necessary training to employees who are idle due to closures, connecting with consumers via emergency contacts, and providing community resources for consumers who have lost their jobs, [or] need food and help advocating with landlords to prevent homelessness. They also are using universal health screening protocols to serve consumers when possible if face-to-face services are still needed for psychiatric crises.One major challenge to telehealth is that many people they serve do not have access to smartphones, computers, or conventional phones, which means providers have to meet face-to-face. Since these organizations generally have minimal need for PPE during normal operations and did not have regular suppliers, there was a lack of and inability to acquire adequate personal protection at the start of the pandemic, which created a major barrier to delivering mental health services.   Q : What staffing challenges do these organizations face?   A : Respondents reported staff members who were idle or under-used due to services that had been closed, like day programs, and a shortage of staff for services that needed to be increased. Although staff have been re-assigned where possible, a mismatch of experience of existing staff and expertise that is currently needed has made placements difficult.Also, the increased, unforeseen expenses of staff overtime and from purchases of technology, software, apps, and PPE were significant for organizations dependent on public support and revenue from Medicaid or other sources. Revenues have already declined as expenses are already increasing. Lack of clarity in regulations has further confounded what was permissible and reimbursable in regard to remote supports, such as Zoom, Skype, or Facetime for both one-on-one and group communication.   Q : What are some solutions to problems confronting healthcare providers?   A : Mental health providers are feeling intense stress in trying to deliver effective services during the pandemic. For moral and social support of staff, supervisors, and administrators should check in with Mental Health Technology Transfer Center , which is funded by the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration and is providing support sessions and resources. The Mental Health Association in New Jersey is also providing support.Both the funding and regulatory environments are changing quickly. The federal government is making money available for telecommunications services, information services, and devices necessary to provide critical connected care services.Statewide advocacy organizations as the New Jersey Association of Mental Health and Addiction Agencies and the New Jersey Psychiatric Rehabilitation Association are monitoring regulatory changes and sharing new guidance that has been coming out. Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services , Medicaid , and the Division of Mental Health Services are providing regulatory flexibility and guidance that we called for in the report. Check these sources frequently as information continues to change.    Source: Rutgers University    Related	NotNews
Report: New York Nursing Home Let Coronavirus-infected Staff Treat Residents  30 Apr 2020, 12:26 by https://www.facebook.com/joelpollak, Joel B. Pollak  New York State officials allowed nursing home employees infected with coronavirus to continue to work and to treat residents at the Hornell Gardens facility in rural Steuben County, according to a New York Post report.  Gov. Andrew Cuomo has come under increasing scrutiny for a March 25 directive ordering nursing homes to accept coronavirus patients. The text of the directive stated (original emphasis): “No resident shall be denied re-admission or admission to the NH [nursing home] solely based on a confirmed or suspected diagnosis of COVID-19. NHs are prohibited from requiring a hospitalized resident who is determined medically stable to be tested for COVID-19 prior to admission or readmission.”  Cuomo has since said that nursing homes could tell the state Department of Public Health they could not accept such patients, or transfer them to other facilities. However, some homes have said that the state was unresponsive when they reached out, and that they felt intense pressure to accept the patients — despite the unique risk coronavirus generally poses to elderly people.  The Post  reported Thursday:  The state Health Department allowed nurses and other staff who tested positive for the coronavirus to continue treating COVID-19 patients at an upstate nursing home, The Post has learned. State officials signed off on the move during an April 10 conference call that excluded local officials from Steuben County, who protested the move, according to a document provided by the county government’s top administrator, Jack Wheeler. At least 15 people have died at the Hornell Gardens nursing home in the tiny town of Hornell since the outbreak, according to county tallies. State records show just seven deaths across the county and include no data about this home.  Roughly one third of the staff and residents at the home have contracted the virus, the Post added.  Last week, Steuben County reported that 73% of its 33 coronavirus deaths at the time had been linked to nursing homes.  Joel B.

Call for community carers to come forward in COVID-19 outbreak  HomeLife, operating across Devon, has more than 100 carer positions available for people able to help shield the county’s most vulnerable  30 Apr 2020, 13:03 by Lewis Clarke  Devonians wishing to make a real difference in the areas where they live during the COVID-19 outbreak are being asked to take a paid role in care in their community.  HomeLife, operating across Devon, has more than 100 carer positions available for people able to help shield the county’s most vulnerable and elderly during the crisis. Full training is given.  Katie Jewell, Regional Manager of HomeLife, which has offices in Barnstaple, Okehampton, Plymouth and Tiverton, and provides care in the surrounding areas too, explained: “Becoming a carer in the community where you live has numerous benefits but, most importantly, you will be vital to the service users you care for and essential to their on-going quality of life.  “As a frontline care professional, you will also be helping to shield them from the Coronavirus and protect our colleagues in the NHS by helping keep our service users safely in their own homes. These jobs are extremely important, highly-skilled, well-paid and emotionally rewarding.  “Our services and the care our carers provide are essential to anyone who has physical disabilities, learning difficulties, spinal injuries, mental health difficulties, palliative care and complex neurological complications.  “It is important that people who need extra support like this are able to stay at home and to be cared for there. The care we provide helps us to protect the NHS from unnecessary calls and resource depilation in this incredibly difficult time.”  HomeLife delivers personalised home care, supporting people wishing to stay living safely and comfortably in their own homes in Devon.  “We know there are many people out there who have been made redundant or laid-off or who are self-employed and just can’t work and need to. Those who have good customer-facing skills and have empathy, compassion and are reliable should get in touch with us. We appreciate many may be hesitant as they have heard care is poorly paid, and staff lack training, support and benefits. This is simply untrue.  “We offer new recruits a five-day training induction and a 12-week onboarding programme working towards a care certificate. We also offer flexible working hours, both full and part-time, as well as competitive wages, generous holiday allocation, and a refer a friend scheme.  “We’re committed to up-skilling our workforce, and we’re working hard to dispel the myth that carers are not valued by society. Being a carer is an essential, highly skilled, professional vocational occupation. We’re searching for people who are looking for a long-term career, as care is a rapidly expanding sector and there is work in the area for many, many years to come.  “We give all our staff full paid additional training when they start and pay for their DBS and shadowing too. A live-in carer also has free accommodation provided during their stay with the service user.  “We offer flexible and supported training and career advancement opportunities that mean we have a highly trained, motivated and appreciated team.  “Our support is not solely elderly care; we offer home care for adults of various abilities, and our team puts people first by helping individuals live independently and providing peace of mind for families. Our service is also completely personalised and ranges from daily visits to respite and overnight care.”  Katie and her team want to hear from kind, honest and reliable people who are considering making a career for themselves in care and would like to know more.  “We provide all our staff full paid training and shadowing before they start, and they have additional, on the job support from a local team 24/7. We give free uniforms and a national staff discount scheme for all major brands, including Tesco, Primark and Argos. It also covers holidays and electrical goods. We have jobs available in Devon now with an immediate start, no experience necessary, just a willingness to care and to learn.  “We are keen to hear from anyone looking for employment. This is a great opportunity for individuals who are seeking a complete career change as full training is given.  “We’re offering those looking for a career in care, flexible contracts, as well as free, full training with the opportunity to achieve industry-wide qualifications.  “Being a carer is a really satisfying job that gives people the opportunity to make a career for themselves that could last a lifetime, something not many other industries can promise at the moment.”  For more information or to enquire about a position at HomeLife, visit https://www.homelifecarers.co.uk .

GP censured after patient was diagnosed with vertigo instead of stroke   30 Apr 2020, 13:09   A patient was diagnosed by his GP as having vertigo when he had suffered a stroke.  The diagnosis was after an examination carried out some eight hours after the doctor was asked to visit the man at home where he had collapsed, the High Court has heard.  Mr Justice Mark Sanfey agreed the GP, Dr Niall O Cleirigh, should be censured with conditions attached to his registration.  A Medical Council Fitness to Practice Committee had made findings of poor professional performance against Dr O Cleirigh over the delay in visiting his patient on January 18 2015, failure to adequately examine him and failure to properly consider whether there was a neurological cause for his condition.  Dr O Cleirigh was also found guilty of poor professional performance arising from having prescribed blood pressure medication for the patient between September 2008 and November 2014 without seeing and reviewing the patient on most occasions over that period.  Today, Mr Justice Sanfey said he considered the Medical Council’s sanction of Dr O Cleirigh, with conditions attached, was appropriate and he saw no good reason not to confirm it.  The order against Dr O Cleirigh, with an address in Rathmines, was sought by J.P. McDowell, solicitor for the Council.  Mr McDowell said the Medical Practitioners Act provides, where a doctor does not appeal a council decision, the council should apply to the High Court to confirm the sanction.  He said Dr O Cleirigh is registered as a specialist in the area of general practice and practices at Pearse Street primary care centre, Dublin 2, and also with an after-hours service.  READ MORE   Patients with severe Covid-19 infections had ‘abnormal’ blood clotting   The doctor had been treating the patient in this case, a man aged in his sixties, since 2008 and had been prescribing him medicines since then.  The man had collapsed in his home on January 18, 2015 and was found by his wife.  His son phoned Dr O Cleirigh about 10.15am.  The doctor was working that day for an out of hours agency and did not see the patient until about 6pm when he diagnosed him as suffering from vertigo and prescribed tablets.  Hours later, about 3am the following day, the man's family summoned an ambulance to take him to a Dublin hospital where he was diagnosed as suffering from a significant stroke, Mr McDowell said.  He was not discharged from hospital for about six months.  The family made a complaint to the Medical Council and that resulted in a hearing before the Fitness to Practice Committee where Dr O Cleirigh made various admissions.  The Committee made findings of poor professional performance concerning the delay in seeing the patient in January 2015, the failure to carry out an adequate examination and the prescription of medication from 2008 to 2014 without regular clinical review.  Having considered the Committee's report last month, the Council decided the doctor should be censured with conditions attached to his registration.  These include he must work with a nominated person to formulate a professional development plan designed to address deficiencies in his practice concerning record keeping, clinical diagnosis, safe prescribing of drugs and ongoing clinical review and monitoring of patients with chronic diseases.

In the Lesser Antilles in particular, two species have been observed over the last few decades: the common green iguana ( I g uana iguana ) which is largely spread throughout the region, and the Lesser Antillean iguana ( Ig uana delicatissima ), endemic to Anguilla , Dominica , Guadeloupe , Martinique , Saint Barthélemy and Sint Eustatius .  Classified as a critically endangered (CR) species in the Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) red list since 2009, the Iguana delicatissima is threatened with extinction, despite initiatives being taken by regional governments and organisations — but is it already too late?  History of the species  The first iguanas appeared in the Antilles more than 7,000 years ago , when the region was still uninhabited. These reptiles were so common in the archipelago — especially in Saint Lucia — that the indigenous Kalinago  named the island Iouanalao , meaning “There where the Iguana is found”.  During the colonial era, these reptiles were chased and eaten by both the Kalinago and the French, who considered them a good source of protein.  Only 13,000 to 20,000 adult iguana still live in the Lesser Antilles, according to the IUCN. The majority of these — 10,000 to 15,000 — is located in Dominica.  Buffering Dominica are the islands of Guadeloupe and Martinique, two French overseas departments that are also home to a significant population of Lesser Antillean iguanas.  Guadeloupe counted 4,000 to 6,000 iguanas on its Petite-Terre islets between 1992 and 1993, and identified nearly 400 adults in the commune of La Désirade . In Martinique, 800 to 1,000 individuals were observed on the Chancel islet in 2013.  In Anguilla, this number rose to 300 in 1998, whereas in Sint Eustatius, the iguana population was somewhere between 275 and 650 in 2004. Last but not least, 300 to 500 adults may live in Saint Barthélemy.  In contrast, the Lesser Antillean iguana is believed to be extinct on the islands of Bonaire , Saba and Saint Martin . It has also completely disappeared on the archipelagos of Antigua and Barbuda and Saint Kitts and Nevis .  Why the decline?  The decline of this species, whose life expectancy can at least reach 15 years , could be linked to two interconnected phenomena: competition and hybridisation . The first occurs when individuals (of the same or different species) are competing over a resource in order to survive and reproduce. The second happens when two similar species give birth to a hybrid offspring.  The incidence of the latter is increased by the resulting environmental impacts of intensive farming and urban inrush . Confronted with the deterioration of the vegetation and reduction of their natural habitats, the iguanas are compelled to live together in smaller spaces.  As a consequence, they tend to mate regardless of their species. The common green iguana, therefore, threatens the existence of the Lesser Antillean iguana because of this crossbreeding, as their hybrid offspring contribute to a reduction in the “pure” Lesser Antillean iguana population.  Moreover, quite apart from having to cope with natural predators, among which are dogs and cats, the Lesser Antillean iguanas are vulnerable to road accidents and hunting.  Regional and international protection  Since the 1970s, governments around the world began to take measures to protect biodiversity. On March 3, 1973, 80 countries adopted the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora (CITES). This binding agreement, signed in Washington, DC, regulates the trade of 30,000 species of plants and 5,800 species of animals, including iguanas.  A decade later, on March 23, 1983, 25 Caribbean states signed the Cartagena Convention for the Protection and Development of the Marine Environment of the Wider Caribbean Region , which grants protection to the Iguana delicatissima . This Specially Protected Areas and Wildlife (SPAW) protocol was signed on January 18, 1990, in Kingston, Jamaica. Both SPAW and CITES were ratified by Dominica, France, the United Kingdom and the Netherlands.  Some countries went further and added the conservation of the species into their own legislation. In 1989, for instance, a French ministerial order made it illegal to hunt, import or trade the Lesser Antillean iguana in Guadeloupe and Martinique . In Guadeloupe, the order initially protected the common green iguana as well, until it was withdrawn from the list of the protected species by an order published on February 10, 2014.  On October 21 and 22, 2009, Dominica hosted a workshop on the conservation of the Lesser Antillean iguana. It served as a basis for the IUCN’s Conservation Action Plan , a document created to ensure the long-term survival of the species in the region.  Similarly, the French Ministry of Ecology launched two national action plans, covering the periods 2011-2015 and 2018-2022 . The current plan aims to protect the Lesser Antillean iguana by countering the proliferation of the green iguana.  An uncertain future  In Dominica and the French Caribbean, citizens are committed to conserving the Lesser Antillean iguana by halting the spread of the common green iguana.  The nonprofit organisation WildDominique , for instance, surveys and captures green iguanas , while educating Dominicans about the importance of conserving the Lesser Antillean iguana. Likewise, the volunteers of the Guadeloupe-based environmental organisation TITÈ (Organisation for the Management of the Natural Areas of La Désirade) carry out catching operations, especially on the island of La Désirade and on the Petite-Terre islets. The success of these exercises is partly dependent on citizen engagement, as people are encouraged to call in whenever they sight a green iguana.  Still, much remains to be done. In Martinique, for example, the Lesser Antillean iguana is still classified as a critically endangered species — the antepenultimate threat level before complete extinction — according to the IUCN's latest red list of threatened species in France, published on April 22, 2020.  Only time will tell if the Lesser Antillean iguana will survive or disappear. Yet, the announcement of the discovery of a new species of black endemic iguana ( Iguana melanoderma ) on the islands of Montserrat and Saba on April 14, 2020, shows the unpredictability of nature.  Nevertheless, many feel that these hopeful signs must not relax conservation efforts.  Read this post in Français	NotNews

Fireblocks Tops $30 Billion in Digital Assets Transfers, Sees Strong APAC Demand  30 Apr 2020, 14:00 by JD Alois     Fireblocks reports having topped $30 billion in digital asset transfers and over $7 billion in monthly transfers, according to a company release.  Fireblocks is an enterprise-grade platform providing the infrastructure for moving, storing, and issuing digital assets. Fireblocks seeks to enable exchanges, custodians, banks, trading desks, and hedge funds to scale digital asset operations.  Fireblocks simultaneously announced several new offices in Asia to better service regional demand. Fireblocks is opening two offices with one being in Hong Kong, the other in Singapore – two established Fintech hubs.  Fireblock’s APAC offices will be led by Stephen Richardson , VP of Product Strategy and Amy Zhang , VP of Sales Asia.  Michael Shaulov , CEO and Co-founder of Fireblocks, said the APAC regions unique ecosystem of trading has driven a huge surge in demand for Fireblock’s services:  “In Hong Kong, Amber Group was one of the first adopters of Fireblocks’ MPC-based technology. Because they are one of Asia’s leading liquidity providers, they need maximum security and strict controls to protect customer funds. The only way to deliver that at scale is through our infrastructure.”  In the region, Amber Group, Blitz Group, Singapore-based crypto hedge fund Three Arrows Capital, and more are said to have implemented MPC with Fireblocks to securely expand digital asset services.  Fireblocks has developed a “ Secure Transfer Environment ” that protects users’ private keys, deposit addresses, and API keys. This has been accomplished via a combination of MPC (multi-party computation) and Intel SGX (chip-level hardware isolation).  Michael Wu, CEO of Amber Group, said that many operators in Asia are transferring large value settlements and require an advanced MPC framework to keep up with new security demands that “HSMs and Multisig solutions fail to address.”  Institutions can securely transfer digital assets between 25+ exchanges, custodians, counterparties, and other wallets.  Fireblocks seeks to eliminate the root cause of digital asset security vulnerabilities with its tech stack. Fireblocks works with many of the largest financial operators in the industry such as B2C2, Celsius, Genesis Global Trading, Galaxy Digital, Woorton, Dunamis, GSR, Blockfills, LGO, Nexo and more.

More than 9,000 fines for coronavirus lockdown breaches in England and Wales   30 Apr 2020, 14:48     Thousands of fines have been issues to people flouting the lockdown rules. Credit: PA   One person was fined six times for allegedly flouting Covid-19 lockdown laws, as it has been revealed more than 9,000 fines were handed to people in England and Wales.  The National Police Chiefs’ Council (NPCC) said 8,877 fixed penalty notices (FPNs) were recorded by forces in England between March 27 and April 27, while 299 were issued in Wales over the same period - a total of 9,176.  Some 397 were for repeat offenders, with one person fined six times.  Police have been given powers to hand out a £60 penalty, that is reduced to £30 if paid within two weeks, for breaches of the government’s restriction rules.

But she said enforcement of the Government’s restriction of movement regulations remains relatively low with more than 200,000 coronavirus-related calls received.    Police say when the sun comes out, so does the public. Credit: PA   Ms Glen said younger people were more likely to breach the lockdown rules, with figures showing around eight out of 10 people fined were men, a third were aged between 18-24 and another third aged 25-34.  “The vast majority of the fines that we’re seeing enforced are people actually not complying, being out in public spaces where they don’t have a reasonable excuse to do so, not listening to the officers’ advice in respect of engaging and explaining to the extent where the officer then has to issue a ticket to secure compliance,” she said.  “There are some definite correlations when it gets hot and when it is good weather where we see troublesome spots, whether that’s beaches or whether that’s countryside, rural communities where people want to go and walk.  “We definitely have seen that when we’ve had hot weather but, on the whole, we are seeing as soon as officers arrive, as soon as they engage and explain, the vast, vast majority of the public are adhering to the rules.”  NPCC chairman Martin Hewitt said: “As the latest provisional figures on the number of fines issued show, the vast majority of people continue to do the right thing, staying at home in order to protect the NHS and help save lives.  “The figures also show our use of the enforcement powers remains proportionate with just 0.02% of the population in England being issued with a fine.”   How many lockdown fines have been issued in your area?

"Police say all leads exhausted in fire that destroyed B.C. heritage hotel   30 Apr 2020, 22:01   Victoria police say there are no more leads to pursue in an arson fire last year that destroyed an abandoned century-old hotel.  The fire in the five-storey Plaza Hotel started on May 6, and covered parts of Victoria in smoke, forcing the closure of city hall and other businesses.  Police spokesman Const. Cam MacIntyre said in a news release Thursday that after a lengthy and co-ordinated effort investigators have exhausted their leads.  MacIntyre said the caretaker, Mike Draeger, was sometimes known to stay in the vacant hotel and hasn't been found, leading investigators to the possibility that he may have died in the fire.  Det. Const. Andre Almeida said in a news conference that Draeger had knowledge of the building that no one else would have.  ""We believe that he is the suspect,"" Almeida said.  The fire burned for five days, while a subsequent search of the debris took another 10 days and required the use of excavators working in a grid pattern to search for evidence.  Almeida said when fire crews arrived they saw flames on the fourth floor and a second crew spotted a fire in the basement of the building.  ""They believe there was at least two fires, so that in itself is suspicious.""  There was also evidence of tampering with the building's sprinkler system, which Almeida said suggested arson.  No human remains were found in the burned out ashes, but Almeida said the fire went on for a long time.  ""So there may not have been any human remains to find.""  Police say the files on the fire and the missing person case will remain open.  (CTV Vancouver Island)  This report by The Canadian Press was first published on April 30, 2020."	NotNews
Prince Harry records message for Thomas the Tank Engine  28 Apr 2020, 03:13 by The Associated Press  LONDON — Prince Harry has recorded a special message to celebrate the 75th anniversary of children’s favourite Thomas the Tank Engine.  The Duke of Sussex introduces a new program called “Thomas and Friends: The Royal Engine,” which has a storyline that includes Harry’s father and grandmother, Prince Charles and Queen Elizabeth II, as animated characters.  Set when the Prince of Wales was a boy, the story sees the friendly engine taking Sir Topham Hatt, the controller of the railway, to Buckingham Palace to receive an honour.  In his introduction — which was recorded in January before his move overseas — Prince Harry is seen sitting in an armchair, reading from a book about the train’s adventures.  In a statement he said he has “fond memories of growing up with Thomas and Friends and being transported to new places through his adventures.”  Thomas “has been a comforting, familiar face to so many families over the last 75 years — entertaining, educating and inspiring children on important issues through exciting stories and characters,” he added.  In January, Prince Harry and his wife Meghan, the Duchess of Sussex, announced they planned to quit as senior royals, seek financial independence and move to North America.  The split became official at the end of March, and the couple are currently in California, where Meghan was raised.  Proof of Prince Harry’s attachment to the engine can also be seen in photos of his first day attending nursery in September 1987, where he is seen carrying a Thomas the Tank Engine bag.  The Rev. Wilbert Awdry released the first book in “The Railway Series” 75 years ago. It was originally created as a bedtime story for his son, Christopher, during a bout of the measles.  The plucky blue tank engine doesn’t appear in the debut story. He got his own illustrated book in 1946 called “Thomas the Tank Engine” and swiftly took over from Edward, Gordon and Henry as everyone’s favourite.  The train tales were turned into a stop-motion animation series in the ’80s, moving into CGI in 2009. “Thomas and Friends,” owned by Mattel, is now on air in over 160 countries worldwide.  British actress Rosamund Pike is also onboard “Thomas and Friends: The Royal Engine,” voicing a new character, an important train called the Duchess of Loughborough.  The show will be aired by Netflix in the U.S. on May 1 and on Channel 5’s “Milkshake” show in the U.K. the following day. It will also be broadcast in Canada and Australia later in the month.

Five family members shot dead inside Milwaukee home  28 Apr 2020, 04:55 by Kenneth Garger  Five people, believed to be members of the same family, were shot dead by a lone gunman in a Milwaukee home on Monday morning, a report said.  The victims, ranging in age from 14 to 41, were found dead inside a home on the city’s north side after a man called 911 and said “his family was dead,” according to the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel , citing police.  A baby inside the residence survived the bloodbath, Milwaukee Mayor Tom Barrett told reporters at the scene. Investigators believe the shooter decided to spare the infant.  The suspected gunman — identified by police sources as 43-year-old Christopher Stokes — was arrested after the 10:30 a.m. shooting.  Police recovered a weapon at the scene.  Milwaukee Police Chief Alfonso Morales said a man called 911 after the carnage and told dispatchers “his family was dead.”  Stokes has several prior arrests dating back to 2002, which prohibit him from legally owning a gun, according to online records.  He was sentenced to four-and-a-half years in prison in 2007 after pleading guilty to felony battery, felony bail jumping and felony intimidation of a witness.  In 2017, he pleaded guilty to misdemeanor disorderly conduct and was sentenced to a month in jail with work-release privileges.   With Post wires	News
MCU 巨擘瑞薩轉盈、毛利率營益率優；股價衝一個半月高  28 Apr 2020, 04:30 by MoneyDJ  新型冠狀病毒（COVID-19，俗稱武漢肺炎）對業績的影響程度不明，微控制器（MCU）巨擘瑞薩電子（Renesas Electronics）暫緩公布本季（2020 年 4~6 月）業績預估，不過因上季（1~3 月）轉盈，毛利率、營益率優預期，帶動瑞薩今日股價暴漲，創一個半月高。  截至台北時間 28 日上午 9 點 45 分，瑞薩暴漲 8.33% 至 520 日圓，稍早最高漲至 541 日圓，漲幅達 12.7%，創 3 月 11 日以來盤中新高水準，表現遠優於東證一部指數下跌 0.53%。     瑞薩 27 日於日股盤後公布上季財報：武漢肺炎疫情擴散，雖提高全球經濟減速疑慮，不過因 2019 年 3 月完成對美國晶片商 Integrated Device Technology（IDT）的收購，IDT 營收列入計算，加上無須像去年同期調整庫存，帶動合併純益自去年同期的虧損 19 億日圓轉為盈餘 112 億日圓。  瑞薩表示，以非一般公認會計原則（Non-GAAP）來看，上季合併營收較去年同期成長 19.0% 至 1,787 億日圓，合併營益暴增 375.4% 至 337 億日圓，毛利率達 47.3%，較去年同期揚升 9.2 個百分點；營益率 18.8% 較去年同期大增 14.1 個百分點。  瑞薩上季毛利率、營益率優於原先自估的 46.0%、15.0%。  就部門別情況來看（基於 Non-GAAP），上季瑞薩「車用事業」（含 MCU、系統單晶片 SoC、類比＆電源控制晶片）營收，較去年同期成長 13.1% 至 935 億日圓，營益飆增 1,340% 至 144 億日圓；「產業／基礎設施／IoT 用事業」（含 MUC、SoC、類比晶片）營收成長 30.3% 至 826 億日圓，營益暴增 222% 至 190 億日圓。  瑞薩指出，因武漢肺炎疫情全球擴散，對事業影響程度不明，現階段難合理估算業績，因此暫緩公布本季業績預估。  日經新聞 15 日報導，為了配合馬來西亞政府的「行動管制令」措施，瑞薩位於馬來西亞、生產車用產業機器用半導體的工廠已縮減產能利用率，瑞薩馬國 3 座工廠產能利用率降至不到 50%。  （本文由 MoneyDJ新聞 授權轉載；首圖來源： 瑞薩電子 ）   延伸閱讀	NotNews
"Two-person-together MRI scans on couples investigates how touching is perceived in the brain  An MRI in each other's arms shows how physical contact alters the brains of couples  28 Apr 2020, 04:00 by Aalto University  Researchers at Aalto University and Turku PET Centre have developed a new method for simultaneous imaging brain activity from two people, allowing them to study social interaction.  In a recent study, the researchers scanned brain activity from 10 couples. Each couple spent 45 minutes inside the MRI scanner in physical contact with each other. The objective of the study was to examine how social contact activates the brain. The results were published in the theme issue Social Interaction in Neuropsychiatry of the journal Frontiers in Psychiatry .  ""This is an excellent start for the study of natural interaction. People don't just react to external stimuli, but adjust their actions moment-by-moment based on what they expect to happen next,"" says Riitta Hari, emerita Professor at Aalto University.  Ordinary magnetic resonance imaging is used to scan one person at a time. In the device developed at Aalto University, the head coil used for regular brain scans was divided into two separate coils. This new design allows for simultaneous scanning of two brains, when the individuals are positioned close enough to each other inside the scanner. During scanning, the participants were face-to-face, almost hugging each other.  When instructed by the researchers, the subjects took turns in tapping each other's lips. Looking at the brain scans, the researchers could see that the motor and sensory areas of the couples' brains were activated.   Studying the fundamentals of human interaction   ""During social interaction, people's brains are literally synchronised. The associated mental imitation of other people's movements is probably one of the basic mechanisms of social interaction. The new technology now developed will provide totally new opportunities for studying the brain mechanisms of social interaction,"" says Professor Lauri Nummenmaa from Turku PET Centre.  ""For example, during a conversation or problem solving, people's brain functions become flexibly linked with each other. However, we cannot understand the brain basis of real-time social interaction if we cannot simultaneously scan the brain functions of both persons involved in social interaction,"" Riitta Hari says.   The study was funded by the European Research Council (ERC) and the Academy of Finland."	News
Dominic Thiem won't donate to Novak Djokovic's coronavirus player relief fund  28 Apr 2020, 05:24 by Neil McLeman, https://www.mirror.co.uk/authors/neil-mcleman/  Dominic Thiem will not donate money to lower-ranked players and claimed: None of them are at risk of starving.  Novak Djokovic wants an ATP Player Relief Fund to support players ranked outside the world’s top 250.  The world No.1 and president of the Player Council wants to raise £790,000 from the top 100 with the top five stars each giving around £24,000.  Thiem, the world No.3 who banked £1.6million for losing the Australian Open Final to Djokovic, said: “None of the lower-ranked players have to fight for their lives. None of them will starve.  “I’ve seen players on the ITF Tour who don’t commit to the sport 100 per cent. Many of them are quite unprofessional. I don’t see why I should give them money.    Djokovic (left) wants the world's top players to donate to fellow professionals - but Thiem (right) said: 'I don’t see why I should give them money' (Image: Getty Images)   “If I have to give, I prefer to help people or institutions in need who can use it during this difficult time. No profession guarantees you big successes at the start of your career.”  Rafa Nadal is “very pessimistic” about the chances of an imminent return of professional tennis.  The Spaniard took part in the shambolic Mutua Madrid Open Virtual Pro yesterday as he beat Canadian Denis Shapovalov in a PS4 match – and then pulled out of a later charity challenge with a “back injury”.  And the 19-time Grand-Slam winner said: “I am very pessimistic that the tour can return to normal activity.  “You travel every week, stay in a hotel, go to different countries. Even if you play behind closed doors, organising an event needs numerous people's participation.”  With 32 top pros contesting the virtual event, Andy Murray beat Benoit Paire, but Jo Konta lost to Sorana Cirstea.

Global Stars — crossing many a hurdle to take to Indian skies  Acrobatic flying team from the UK shares details of the exhaustive preparation that goes into their breathtaking moves  28 Apr 2020, 05:50 by Ashwini Phadnis  Their love for India and the chance to do another round of acrobatic flying at the recently concluded Hyderabad air show saw the Global Stars team of flying enthusiasts from the UK participating in the four-day air show despite the shadow of the coronavirus looming large.  What brought Global Stars’ eight pilots, who are qualified to do acrobatic flying, together, and keeps them together, is their enthusiasm for flying and the thrill of acrobatic flying. Coming to India to take part in the air show meant that this team, which has participated in air shows across the world, had to deal with some logistical issues. Last time one of them flew one of the six planes that the team uses — the German-made Extra 300 — he had to make a number of stops on the way, including in France, Greece, Jordan, Oman and Pakistan.  Hence, this year they decided to ship the aircraft and reassemble them on arrival. Incidentally it takes one-and-a-half a days to assemble an aircraft. “It takes about six people just to lift the wing and put it in place,” said Chris Burkett, a member of the team. Each aircraft costs about a quarter of a million pounds.  Doing acrobatic flying is not easy. The small aircraft fly at speeds of around 200 miles an hour and the pilots cannot afford to go very high as then their acrobatics will not be visible to those on the ground.  “Ideally, we should be flying at 2,000 feet or less. Otherwise we might not be clearly visible to the spectators on the ground. Sometimes we fly as low as 200 feet and the maximum we try and go is about 1,500 feet,” Burkett said.  Mirror Loop move  The performance that they put up in Hyderabad was breathtaking. One manoeuvre, the Mirror Loop, carried out by Stephen Craver and Burkett, had Craver flying the outside loop which meant that he and his aircraft were upside down. In the other aircraft, Burkett watched him closely to stay in a mirror position all the way. “Stephen’s job was to fly the loop while my job was to focus on him. I could almost reach out in the sky and touch his aircraft,” Burkett said, giving one a sense of how close the two aircraft were. The two flew at speeds of between 100 and 200 miles an hour.  Preparing for acrobatic flying involves mental rehearsal of the flying sequences over and over again to make sure that everyone knows where they should be in the air.  Such flying can be risky and almost all the pilots have had close moments. Burkett recalled that once while doing acrobatic flying in England the aircraft he was flying had an engine failure, forcing him to do a hard landing which broke all his vertebra. “But I recovered very quickly and was back in the air in about three months,” he added.  For Carver, a former commercial airline pilot with over 25 years of flying experience with a major UK carrier, this was his second visit to India. Having done both, he believes that commercial flying is more sedate, while acrobatic flying involves a lot more preparation and planning if the pilot does not want to get any unpleasant surprises while in the air.  “Indians are very appreciative of what we do,” Carver said, as he prepared to go up in the sky over Hyderabad. And this is perhaps the reason why the Global Stars team came even in such trying times to take part in the biennial Hyderabad air show.   Get Free Trial  Hurry!

Nigeria to relax Covid-19 lockdown measures  28 Apr 2020, 05:00 by AfricaNews, https://www.facebook.com/africanews.channel   Nigerian President Muhammadu Buhari announced Monday evening a gradual easing of confinement measures in Africa’s most populous country from 4 May, but will impose a night curfew and the wearing of masks.   “I have decided to put in place gradual easing of lockdown measures,” he said in a much-anticipated television address.  “We will implement a curfew between 8 p.m. and 6 a.m.,” President Buhari said.  Inter-state borders will remain closed except for basic necessities (...). We will impose the wearing of masks in public places, as well as social distancing measures.  “Inter-state borders will remain closed except for basic necessities (…). We will impose the wearing of masks in public places, as well as social distancing measures,” the head of state added.  These new measures will not apply to the state of Kano, which in recent days has recorded a large number of “mysterious deaths” that are still being autopsied, according to local authorities.  The containment measures, imposed by the federal government in three states (Lagos, Abuja and Ogun) and applied in several other states by the governors, have led to severe social tensions in Nigeria, where the majority of the population depends on the informal economy for survival.  Many voices have been raised in sub-Saharan Africa to warn against measures that are not applicable in the economic and social context of the continent to the vast majority of the very poor population.  Nigeria had on Monday nearly 1,300 officially reported cases of coronavirus infection and 40 deaths, but many voices were raised to denounce the insignificant number of tests carried out in the most populous country in Africa with a population of 200 million.

"Covid-19: Delhi sees surge in recovery rate; 877 patients released so far  Since April 18, the Delhi government in its daily health bulletin has introduced a recovery column in an effort to have a more clear understanding of the overall recovery rate  28 Apr 2020, 02:15 by ANI  The national capital is seeing a surge in the number of patients being recovered from the coronavirus. As per the health bulletin of Delhi government, till Sunday with 1,987 active cases, the number of recovered patients is 877, while the death count stands at 54.  ""If you see the figures of the patients who have recovered and gone back is quite encouraging and better than any other States in the country. The percentage of people becoming asymptomatic from symptomatic is more as compared to the people going to ICU or on ventilators,"" said Dr JC Passi, Medical Director, Lok Nayak Jai Prakash Narayan and GB Pant Hospitals, while talking to ANI.  Experts earlier confirmed that the biggest comorbidity is the age. People falling under 60 plus age group are more vulnerable as most of them are hypertensive, have some cardiac ailments or diabetes.  Dr Rakesh Garg, Additional Professor, Department of Onco-Anaesthesia and Palliative Medicine, who is currently working at COVID Facility, National Cancer Institute, AIIMS-Jhajjar, said that around 80 per cent of the patients are having mild symptoms of coronavirus.

He said the majority of patients, who need ICU facility or even expired, are elderly people or people with co-morbidity among whom the poor outcome of the treatment is noticed.  Since April 18, the Delhi government in its daily health bulletin has introduced a recovery column in an effort to have a more clear understanding of the overall recovery rate.  BL Sherwal, Medical Director, Rajiv Gandhi Super Speciality Hospital, a designated state COVID-19 hospital, said: ""The recovery rate as of now is very high. We have around 190 positive cases of which most have mild symptoms.""  ""The majority of them has recovered. We have discharged many of them after they were tested negative. Importantly the mortality rate is also very low with only two deaths here at Rajiv Gandhi Hospital. However, a strategy needs to be built on how people respond after the lockdown is over.

Govt likely to amend NAB laws through new ordinance  28 Apr 2020, 20:04 by News Desk  The federal government is likely to amend the law of the National Accountability Bureau (NAB) through a new ordinance, a local news outlet reported on Tuesday.  Reportedly, after the new ordinance, special courts will be empowered to decide about the bail of people accused of corruption.  The new ordinance would also end NAB chairman’s authority for releasing the arrest warrant of an accused person.  The federal government is also considering to add a disqualification clause, whereby anyone found guilty of corruption would be disqualified form holding a public position for five years, regardless of whether they voluntarily submit the looted money or not.  Reportedly, Law Minister Farogh Naseem apprised Prime Minister Imran Khan regarding amended laws in making and has asked him to take other political parties into confidence over the matter. A government committee comprising Pervez Khattak and Asad Umar will take political parties and other stakeholders into confidence regarding the new NAB ordinance.	News
Lexus axes GS and GS-F, new V8 planned for future models  The Lexus mid-size rear-drive sedan will effectively be replaced by the front-drive Lexus ES, but the company is working on future V8 performance models.  28 Apr 2020, 18:07 by Joshua Dowling  - shares       Toyota’s luxury division Lexus is poised to end production of the GS sedan – including the V8-powered GS-F performance model – by the end of this year. Lexus dealers in Australia are clearing remaining stock.  A statement from Lexus Australia said Japan has “confirmed production of the GS and GS-F will cease later this year” and that “the GS and GS-F remain available in Australian dealerships”.  Japanese media reports claim the current generation Lexus GS will reach the end of the production line in August, with the last examples due to be sold out in dealerships by the end of this year.  The Lexus GS is currently available with a choice of 2.0-litre turbo four-cylinder power, a 3.5-litre V6, a 3.5-litre V6 matched to hybrid technology, and a 5.0-litre V8 for the high-performance GS-F.  The rear-drive Lexus GS series – a rival to the BMW 5 Series and Mercedes E-Class – will effectively be replaced by the front-drive Lexus ES range; both models are almost identical in length bumper-to-bumper however the ES has more rear legroom because the floor is flatter due to the layout of its powertrain.     The departure of the GS line-up will leave just two V8s in the Lexus passenger car range for the foreseeable future.  The remaining V8s in the Lexus range for the time being are the RC-F and LC coupes, which are also powered by a 5.0-litre V8.  The Toyota LandCruiser-based  Lexus LX 4WD is expected to phase out its petrol and diesel V8 options and switch to V6 power when the next generation arrives a few years from now.  However, Lexus won’t abandon V8 engines altogether; it is working on a new high-performance twin turbo V8 that will be used in road cars and racing applications.  Lexus announced late last year it was planning to race a new generation, twin turbo V8 in this year’s Nurburgring 24-Hour race.  The motorsport campaign was designed to test a new V8 that would eventually be used in future Lexus road cars.  At the time, Lexus said: “The (race) team will use what it has learnt in the past two years to improve the car’s performance by adopting a variety of new technologies, including a newly-developed V8 twin-turbo engine destined for use on future road cars such as sports cars”.      1 2        nextprevious Lexus axes GS and GS-F, new V8 planned for future models	NotNews
"Scrap coronavirus refunds to save airlines, lobbyists tell Brussels  28 Apr 2020, 18:29 by Oliver Whitfield Miocic  euronews_icons_loading     Airline passengers who have flights cancelled because of the COVID-19 pandemic will lose their right to a refund if lobbyists get their way, the EU’s Transport Commissioner has told Euronews  Adina Valean told Euronews that some member states want Brussels to ease existing refund rules to help bail out cash-strapped airline companies.  But Valean said that if airlines want to protect their bottom lines they need to focus on making voucher schemes more acceptable to customers.  Tens of thousands of European airline passengers have been unable to obtain ticket refunds, with companies offering vouchers or replacement flights instead. European regulations say passengers must be offered a refund if a flight is cancelled.  “I know these governments are requesting the Commission to change the law,” Valean told Euronews Now.  “It’s not an option for me. I don’t think that this is the right path. I think companies have to put their energy and thinking into making the vouchers more attractive if they want to use mainly this instrument, but allow passengers to exercise their right to be reimbursed.”    Coronavirus: European airlines refusing to refund passengers for cancelled flights    European airlines could face class-action suit over unpaid coronavirus refunds    Air France-KLM is among the companies not offering refunds to passengers - despite receiving €11 billion in aid from the French and Dutch governments. KLM told Euronews that current regulations were not designed to deal with the exceptional circumstances of a pandemic.  ""Regulations have been developed in anticipation of localized and short term disruptions,"" it said in a statement.  “No text envisaged the ban and travel restrictions that have begun in recent weeks. KLM believes that the issuance of a refundable voucher constitutes a fair solution and a reasonable balance between the protection of their passengers and the operational realities that every airline has to face.”  Valean said passengers seeking a refund need first to go to their national authorities before any case can be referred to a European level  “My only dialogue is with the member states and I am doing my best to convince them to put pressure on the companies to back European law,” she said. “I don’t take action against airlines. I would like to step up to the frontline but unfortunately this is not the role of the Commissioner.”  KLM customer Noémi Gombas has been trying and failing to get a refund for her flight ticket.  “I think it is unfair, immoral and also illegal,” she told Euronews. “I think that the EU’s position is pretty clear. I think they are on the right side of this. I think they are saying all the right things.  ""The problem is enforcement and the Dutch government and namely the Dutch enforcement body was instructed to let KLM get away with this. So I hope the EU will step up and that there will be consequences.”  The Director-General of the International Air Transport Association Alexandre De Juniac said airlines fully understood that passengers were unhappy.  But he said the dire financial situation made full immediate cash refunds impossible.  “We are in a terrible situation in which we are fighting to survive and the cash drain that we have already is putting us almost in bankruptcy,” he said.  De Juniac said the IATA was suggesting delayed refunds as a compromise solution.    Watch the full report"	NotNews
Opinion  The Guardian view on Covid-19 and care homes: promises are not enough  The coronavirus crisis has still not peaked in the social care sector. Flattening this curve must be the government’s absolute priority  28 Apr 2020, 18:35 by Editorial    Coronavirus – latest updates    See all our coronavirus coverage    Boris Johnson has a talent for arresting phrase-making, and it was duly deployed outside Downing Street as he returned to active duty. Comparing Covid-19 to a street mugger, the prime minister said that as a result of ongoing lockdown measures, the country has begun to “wrestle it to the floor”, as recorded infection rates and NHS hospital deaths from the disease fall from their early April peaks.  Not for the first time in his career, Mr Johnson’s rhetoric was vivid, but it expressed at best a partial truth. Barely 24 hours later, the Office for National Statistics published an estimate by the Care Quality Commission that 4,334 people died from coronavirus in care homes in the fortnight leading up to 24 April.  Half of those CQC-reported deaths occurred within the final five days. As the curve of hospital deaths flattens and begins to descend, Westminster’s political energies have moved restlessly on to the question of how lockdown restrictions might be eased. But care workers are bracing for a deadly peak that has yet to come.  The struggle to protect the nation’s vulnerable and elderly must not be fought in lonely isolation, out of sync with the national mood. At the Downing Street press briefing on Tuesday, the health secretary, Matt Hancock , claimed that the potential crisis in care homes “was something we focused on right from the start”. But that social care became the forgotten frontline of the coronavirus crisis is generally accepted.  This week, we learned that ministers were warned by scientific advisers in January that care homes would be especially vulnerable to a pandemic. From personal protective equipment to testing, the response from the government to that advice was belated and inadequate. What is urgently needed now is the application of genuine political imagination to mitigate a tragic situation which is moving towards a deadly climax. Care homes need immediate help in three specific areas – medical equipment, human resources and financial capability.  The proper provision of PPE for care workers must be made an absolute priority for the government. Access to increased testing capacity, which remains haphazard and sketchy, must be vastly improved. Mr Hancock has announced that care homes will now be able to test asymptomatic as well as symptomatic carers and residents. This is welcome, as is the commitment to publish daily figures on care home deaths. But when some care homes are still struggling to perform any tests at all, the promise doesn’t count for much.  The National Care Forum, which represents 120 not-for-profit providers, has called for acute care specialists and geriatricians normally based in the NHS to lend their expertise in managing outbreaks. Their knowledge, and the experience they acquired during the early April hospital peak, could be an invaluable resource.  About 25,000 retired doctors and nurses responded to government calls to return to the NHS; their skills would be a vital boost in residential homes. Members of the 750,000-strong NHS “volunteer army”, most of whom have not been called on, could be diverted to perform specific tasks. Meanwhile, a financial lifeline from central government is also desperately needed: myriad extra costs have left large numbers of providers close to the edge.  The NHS has not been overwhelmed by the pandemic. Mr Johnson was right to celebrate that fact as he returned to Downing Street. The belated lockdown gave hospitals the headroom they needed. The same sense of urgency must finally inform the government’s response to the crisis in our care homes.	News

More than half of passengers vehicles sales are at risk due to Covid-19: Crisil  28 Apr 2020, 11:43 by Our Bureau  In an analysis of district-wise sales pattern of automobiles by CRISIL Research, which segregated districts by the level of risk from the coronavirus pandemic, ‘high impact’ and ‘very high impact’ districts together account for 56 per cent of two-wheeler sales, and 68 per cent of passenger vehicle sales.  As things stand, even if the nation-wide lockdown is lifted on May 3, the resumption of normal operations at automobile dealerships would depend on whether a dealership is outside the demarcated hotspots and if it has the necessary licences from the state/ district administration to operate, it said in a statement on Tuesday.  To capture the magnitude of risk for automobile sales, the credit rating agency deployed a two-factor framework, comprising the industry’s sales opportunity and the size of risk from Covid-19.  This was captured in terms of district-wise concentration of sales and growth momentum, and the risk in terms of district-wise assessment of present case intensity and further risks of virus spread, it said.  Sales of discretionary automobiles such as passenger vehicles and two-wheelers are likely to remain under pressure in the near term, it noted.  District-wise sales pattern  “An analysis of district-wise sales pattern reveals that the passenger vehicle segment has higher inherent risk compared with two-wheelers, because of a relatively higher concentration of sales in the top 100 districts. These districts account for 62 per cent of passenger vehicle sales and only 45 per cent of two-wheeler sales, in terms of volume,” said Ajay Srinivasan, Director, CRISIL Research.  In ‘very high impact’ districts, the level of risk is considerably different for the two segments, with half of passenger vehicle sales and a third of two-wheeler sales expected to be impacted, said CRISIL.  Besides, GDP growth is forecast to slow down to 1.8 per cent this fiscal, portending demand-side pressures, it said.  On the brighter side, 44 per cent and 32 per cent of the market for two-wheelers and passenger vehicles, respectively, lies in ‘very low to moderate’ risk districts, where normalcy is likely to return relatively more quickly, although in a phased manner, said CRISIL.  Automobile manufacturers and vehicle financiers need to tactically target low-to-moderately impacted districts and also appropriately retune their strategies in high-to-very high impact districts to minimise the impact on their sales performance, said the rating agency.  “Players in the industry will have to devise a strategy after carefully considering their product portfolios, sales distribution by district and dealership presence – all of which are key to pushing volumes in this scenario. Prioritisation of districts on the basis of opportunities and risks will be the new matrix to work on,” said Hemal N Thakkar, Associate Director, CRISIL Research.	News

READ: As Indonesia's Idul Fitri travel curbs kick in, some relieved to reach hometown while others are stranded   A senior member of the government's COVID-19 taskforce, Wiku Adisasmito, did not dispute the Reuters findings but declined to comment on the number of coronavirus victims he believed were to be found among the patients classified as PDP.  He said many of the 19,897 suspected coronavirus sufferers in Indonesia had not been tested because of long queues of specimens awaiting processing at under-staffed laboratories.  Some people had died before their sample was analysed, he said.  ""If they have thousands or hundreds of samples they need to test, which one will they give the priority? They will give the priority to the people that are still alive,"" he told Reuters.  Adisasmito is the most senior public health expert on Indonesia's COVID-19 taskforce and the press office of President Joko Widodo typically refers queries to the taskforce.

REUTERS/Willy Kurniawan   According to the Ministry of Health's most recent COVID-19 guidelines, patients classified as PDP are those with acute respiratory illnesses for which there is no clinical explanation other than the new coronavirus.  To be classified as PDP, patients must also have travelled to a country, or an area in Indonesia, where the coronavirus has taken hold within 14 days of becoming sick.  ""I believe the vast majority of PDP deaths were caused by COVID-19,"" said Pandu Riono, an epidemiologist at the University of Indonesia, citing their COVID-19 symptoms and that there was no other identified cause of death.  Some senior government members played down the risk of an outbreak in January and February with some suggesting that prayer, herbal remedies and hot weather would help ward off the virus. The death toll is now the highest in Asia after China, according to a Reuters tally.   BURIALS   The provincial data follows a report by Reuters this month that burials in the capital Jakarta in March were up by 40 per cent on any month since at least January 2018.  The city's governor told Reuters that coronavirus was the only likely explanation.

REUTERS/Willy Kurniawan/File Photo   Indonesia had officially recorded 9,096 coronavirus infections as of Apr 27. It has conducted 210 tests per million people. Neighbouring Australia has tested 100 times more per capita, while Vietnam's testing is about 10 times higher.  ""The true infection and death rate are higher than the officially reported data because our tests are still a very low number compared to the population,"" said Dr Iwan Ariawan, an epidemiologist from the University of Indonesia.  President Joko Widodo's government has been accused by activists and his political opponents of a lack of transparency in handling the epidemic.  The government says it has taken appropriate measures, but Widodo said last month that some information had been withheld from the public to prevent panic.  Widodo said last week he had told his ministers to report COVID-19 data truthfully. His government announced a new transparency initiative two weeks ago but a promised new website with all the data has yet to be launched.

Adisasmito said the government was not hiding data and that he was unaware the WHO had called for suspected COVID-19 death statistics to be made public.

VodafoneZiggo shuffles 4G spectrum for 5G launch  28 Apr 2020, 11:41 by Manny Pham  VodafoneZiggo heralded the launch of commercial 5G services, several weeks before an official auction of next-generation frequencies is scheduled to take place in the Netherlands.  In a statement, the operator said it would begin offering 5G from today (28 April) by rejigging its 4G network using a spectrum sharing system from Ericsson. The service will initially be available “in more than half of the Netherlands” with nationwide coverage due “by late July”.  CEO Jeroen Hoencamp explained availability of the service is possible “because 5G is an evolution”.  “We will make use of innovative technology to apply 5G in existing frequency bands, using our existing antennas,” he added, highlighting growing demand for mobile data “and developments of today and tomorrow”, particularly around AR and VR services, as an apparent motivation.  Ericsson noted VodafoneZiggo turned off its 3G network in February, which freed capacity in the 2100MHz band, with the operator adding it began marketing 5G tariffs a month later.  However, despite what Hoencamp said was a move making VodafoneZiggo “the frontrunner” in the next-generation technology, the launch comes well in advance of an auction of 5G frequencies in the country.  Under plans outlined in December 2019 , the Netherlands intends to conduct a sale of 700MHz, 1400MHz and 2100MHz frequencies in June. A sale of 3.5GHz spectrum is scheduled to take place in 2022, with the band currently being used by the nation’s satellite defence system.  Subscribe to our daily newsletter Back	News
Navarro: Dårlige og falske tester fra Kina  28 Apr 2020, 11:09 by Hans Rustad      Peter Navarro. Foto: Leah Millis/Reuters/Scanpix   Peter Navarro sier testing er helt nødvendig for å gjenåpne USA. Da er det ytterst skadelig at Kina sender tester av dårlig kvalitet og endog falsk vare.  Navarro er Trumps spesialforhandler og tidligere Demokrat. Navarro sa USA er avhengig av testing:  “That’s where, perhaps, we can find people who are immune, that can be in the workplace in a more safe environment. But we can’t have China, for example, bringing in those fake tests and counterfeit tests, because that’s going to be very disruptive,” Navarro told Fox and Friends. “There’s a lot of these antibody tests coming in from China now that are low quality, false readings and things like that.”  Navarro er meget direkte i sin omtale av Kina. Han gjentar at Kina med viten og vilje lot viruset bli spredt til resten av verden.  “They could have contained it in Wuhan,” he said. “They didn’t. They seeded the world with this, with hundreds of thousands of Chinese getting on aircraft to Milan, to New York and other places.”  I intervallet på seks uker, da Kina visste at viruset var på vei ut i verden, kjøpte Kina opp verneutstyr fra hele verden, slik at de satt på lagrene når andre land våknet til faren.  On Monday, Navarro charged that during the time it delayed reporting, China “vacuumed up the world for personal protective equipment” needed by healthcare workers. “And today China’s profiteering basically from this situation,” he added.  Men Navarro introduserte også en ny ide om hvorfor Kina var tilbakeholdende med informasjon om viruset: Det ville være det første landet som utviklet en vaksine.  A week ago, Navarro charged that China may be withholding data about early coronavirus infections because it wants to win the commercial race to create a vaccine. There are currently no approved treatments or vaccines for COVID-19.  Trump-administrasjonen er direkte overfor Kina og det faller ikke i god jord.  on Monday Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Hua Chunying said on Twitter Pompeo should “stop playing the political game. Better save energy on saving lives.”  Dette er samme linje som WHO fører: Ikke bruk kreftene på politikk, men stå sammen om å redde liv.  Det holder ikke helt hvis Beijing og WHO sammen førte verden bak lyset og lot viruset spre seg.   White House adviser Navarro lashes out at China over ‘fake’ test kits    Les også	NotNews
"Trevor Noah Turns Trump's Claim He Was Kidding About Injecting Disinfectants Into a More Credible Comedy Set (Video)  No one thinks POTUS was kidding  28 Apr 2020, 11:43 by Ross A. Lincoln     “The Daily Show” wasn’t able to cover the weirdness last Thursday when Donald Trump suggested that people inject disinfectant into their lungs in order to cure coronavirus, and then claimed the next day that he was just being sarcastic. But on Monday, the show returned with a look at the whole weird deal that imagined what it would be like if it was just a bad standup comedy set.  For those catching up, during his coronavirus press conference on Thursday, Trump literally asked medical experts on his coronavirus task force if people could inject disinfectant or even UV light (no, really) into their bodies as a means of fighting COVID-19. (They can’t. Please don’t do that.)  The next day the White House tried to claim that Trump was taken out of context, only for Trump to ruin that excuse by claiming he was actually being sarcastic. The White House didn’t have a good explanation as to why a sitting president would joke about a plague that has already killed more than 50,000 people, and video of the exchange doesn’t support the interpretation that Trump was joking. Not even Fox News accepted that excuse .   Also Read:    Unsurprisingly, his comments were widely mocked — even disinfectant maker Lysol got involved , saying in a statement that “under no circumstance should our disinfectant products be administered into the human body (through injection, ingestion or any other route).” After all, poison can kill. By Friday night, it was reported that Trump would be ending his daily coronavirus briefings. Whoops.  Back to “The Daily Show” and Noah. After recapping more of the weird twists and turns of the story, Noah got to Trump’s claim he was being sarcastic. “Now we’ve learned something new from Donald Trump. While the nation is chewing into these briefings for accurate information, Trump is just testing out his newest comedy material, and pulling everyone’s leg.”  At this point, video changed to a humorous deep fake in which video of Trump’s head from Thursday was put on what looks like a comedian in a comedy club, with video of audiences laughing thrown in for effect.   Also Read:    “One upside of this whole debacle is that Donald Trump has given Americans the perfect excuse, the perfect excuse for electing him,” Noah then said. “When all this is over, and all the other countries are asking ‘how the hell did you elect Donald Trump,’ Americans can be like ‘no dude, dude dude. We were just being sarcastic.'”  Watch the clip above .

Domino's NZ Fires Up The Ovens Once Again  28 Apr 2020, 16:19 by Domino's Pizza    Domino's Physical Distancing   Domino’s team members across New Zealand are proudly putting on their uniforms and returning to work this morning, as stores open for their first day of trade after nearly five weeks of Alert Level 4 lockdown.  NZ Domino’s General Manager Cameron Toomey said weeks of planning had gone into the re-opening to ensure the ongoing safety of team members and customers.  “We have been working towards this day since before lockdown even began – making sure that all of our safety processes are as robust as possible to keep our team members and customers safe during this time,” Mr Toomey said.  Domino’s took on board government and World Health Organisation (WHO) advice, and reviewed best-practice from around the world to formulate a number of new safety processes.  “Having access to a global network allowed us to investigate and implement new, preventative measures in an extremely short period of time.  “We had already started using a number of these processes before lockdown began, such as Zero Contact Delivery and more frequent hygiene and sanitisation practices, and have now implemented many more, including physical distancing and temperature testing in our stores,” Mr Toomey said.  “We have also had these processes verified by a third-party to ensure we are doing everything possible to keep our team members, customers and communities safe.”  Feeding the frontline was a major focus for the Company prior to the Alert Level 4 lockdown. This morning, Domino’s Head Office staff opened the Mt Eden store early to treat local frontline workers to their favourite pizza.    First pizza out of the oven at the Mt Eden store destined to feed frontline workers this morning   “Prior to lockdown, our local store owners and teams safely delivered around 30,000 pizzas to essential workers across the country.  “After we closed, we then asked the public to nominate frontline organisations to receive vouchers to use upon our re-opening in recognition of their hard work and dedication. We’ll be sending out vouchers for an additional 2,500 pizzas to these worthy recipients in the coming days,” Mr Toomey said.  We know there will be high expectations – from our customers, from our communities and from ourselves but we know we can live up to them.  We understand what a privilege it is to be able to safely serve our local communities at this time and look forward to delivering the joy of pizza to Kiwis once again.”  Domino’s safety procedures include:   Zero Contact Delivery ( https://www.dominos.co.nz/zero-contact )  Robust procedures around cleanliness, sanitisation and safely preparing customer’s orders  Physical distancing of team members in-store  Temperature testing of all team members prior to beginning their shift  Zero Contact Takeaway – currently being trialled in a number of stores prior to rollout in early May.

Move to lock-up patients in containment zone backfires  Gadwal administration backtracks after facing flak for locking houses  28 Apr 2020, 16:39 by Abhinay Deshpande  Jogulamba-Gadwal district authorities ‘locked up’ some houses in containment zones from outside to prevent the residents from venturing out. However, the officials backtracked within hours as the experiment drew severe criticism from the public.  The officials in the presence of Gadwal Municipal Commissioner Narsimha and a sub-inspector of police put locks on at least half a dozen houses in Nallakunta and Ramnagar areas of the town to ensure ‘strict’ enforcement of lockdown.  Gadwal, one of the eight COVID-19 hotspot districts in Telangana, reported 45 positive cases, out of whom 10 patients recovered and were discharged, while one succumbed. Currently, the Gadwal town has seven containment zones, and four in another mandal.  When contacted, a senior official in the district administration maintained that they had to resort to such an unconventional measure to demonstrate to the residents how strict the lockdown can be. “We have locked more than six houses in the town preventing people from coming out while installing the barricades in their areas. We wanted to show them how lockdown is implemented in the red zone to contain the spread of deadly coronavirus,” the officer said.  They locked the house of a positive patient and his adjoining house in Ramnagar.  While another officer said that the decision of locking the houses with the residents inside was taken after getting a nod from senior officials as people were not following their repeated instructions and were moving out freely in the area.  “It was needed to curb their movement. People are not listening and we did it for their own safety by keeping top officials in the loop,” he said requesting anonymity.  However, authorities soon received flak from the public and backtracked, with the locks remaining on doors for no more than a day or even less.  Sources said that the officers were worried over the increasing number of cases from Kurnool after several persons from Gadwal visited a lady doctor in Kurnool, who subsequently died of COVID-19.

Vancouver's brief run of free parking is over  28 Apr 2020, 17:05 by Tarnjit Parmar   Summary   The City of Vancouver is reinstating paid parking this week  Free parking will remain at hospitals for front-line workers during the pandemic  Councilor Sarah Kirby-Yung people have been abusing free parking by parking all day for free   VANCOUVER (NEWS 1130) — City Council has decided that free parking across the city has run its course – with paid parking being reinstated this week, including meters.  Councillor Sarah Kirby-Yung is praising the decision – saying it will help offer some relief when it comes to the city’s financial woes.  “The City of Vancouver has a revenue gap that we need to close and it’s really important, I think, that we don’t forego any revenues. Unnecessarily parking is our third-largest source of revenue, and that equates to about five per cent of the city’s budget,” she says.     She adds others were abusing the system and parking all day for free – leading to additional traffic on the roads.  “At the end of March, the staff took an operational decision to relax parking enforcement across the city. And that was done as a human gesture to support parking availability for frontline workers and hospital workers and what we found is that people weren’t respecting that and the streets are filling up,” she tells NEWS 1130.  Kirby-Yung has been calling for the change, saying the money generated is needed to the city’s dwindling finances.  “The one hand if we’re trying to make sure we have all the revenue coming in so we had out mayor go out and say that the city needs cash and ask for operational grants. We’ve had comments made that we might have to raise property taxes, but I think that we can’t be doing that unless we are prepared to ensure that we are doing everything we can to bring in revenue and not foregoing revenues and money to leave on the table,” she explains.  She says it’s important the city focuses on business working to survive through the pandemic, and people trying to make their next rent payment.  “We need to focus on what the city can do to support them, and if residents and businesses are healthy businesses, then our city will be healthy,” she says.  The city has not announced a date, but the decision will be implemented sometime this week.  Kirby-Yung adds parking will remain free at hospitals to help support front line health care workers.

Coronavirus Philadelphia: US Attorney’s Office Launching Task Force To Crack Down On COVID-19 Scammers  28 Apr 2020, 17:14 by Syndicated Local – CBS Philly  PHILADELPHIA (CBS) – The U.S. Attorney’s Office in Philadelphia is launching a task force to crack down on scammers taking advantage of people during the pandemic. The new effort relies on tips from the public.  Earlier this month, federal authorities seized a huge stockpile of medical equipment from a hoarder in Brooklyn and at a warehouse in New Jersey.    Coronavirus Latest: What You Need To Know And Staying Connected    The supplies included hundreds of thousands of masks and gloves.

The U.S. Attorney’s Office in Philadelphia is concerned about similar incidents happening in our area, so it has created its own coronavirus task force.  “If anybody, for example, is hawking fake tests, fake cures, fake vaccines; if there’s any illegal hoarding or price gouging going on, basically, anybody trying to illegally profit off this pandemic, that’s something we’re aggressively prosecuting, aggressively investigating,” McSwain said.    LATEST CORONAVIRUS STORIES    McSwain didn’t want to reveal any details about those investigations but did say they’re receiving information from a variety of sources, and tips from the public are crucial.  “We want to make sure that nobody is getting taking advantage of,” McSwain said.

Coronavirus Pandemic Could Make Big Companies More Powerful  28 Apr 2020, 17:02 by S Narayan  Highlights   In an interesting analysis, Bloomberg reported on Tuesday that the Coronavirus pandemic raging through most parts of the world could well refashion...    In an interesting analysis, Bloomberg reported on Tuesday that the Coronavirus pandemic raging through most parts of the world could well refashion the economy in a way that larger companies play a bigger role. In terms of both employment and revenue share, the bigger companies could move in with greater strength, the report suggests. It will not merely be survival of the fittest but a case of the powerful getting more dominant and stronger.  The advantage which bigger companies enjoy is clearly because of deeper pockets and wider presence, the Bloomberg report suggests, among other things. Predictably, the hardest hit by the Coronavirus pandemic have been small and medium-sized businesses, in India, as in in other parts of the world. It is for this reason that Prime Minister Narendra Modi in his interaction with chief ministers on Monday, asked them to focus on the small and medium-sized sector. These businesses are cash-strapped, and the government would find it difficult to prop them up through policy measures.  The other significant feature which would emerge as pointed out by the Bloomberg report is that big companies will control supply chains. This will be a two-way street, since suppliers would also find it more reliable to lean on large companies. The report also indicates that employees feel more secure working larger companies. This is true of customer confidence as well, it suggests.  The social value of certain sectors such as bio-pharma and technology will go up, according to the Bloomberg report.Another key advantage which large companies have is their ability to leverage technology, especially information technology. The report suggests that here again, the smaller and medium-sized firms may take a hit.   Email Article  Print Article      Next Story	News
COVID-19: France cancel Ligue 1 season  28 Apr 2020, 17:38 by Bowale Odutola   Share on Facebook  Share on Twitter   The French football season has been cancelled after all sporting events – even behind closed doors – were banned until September.  As such, LFP bosses have given up their hopes of restarting the current campaign.  The decision was made as Prime Minister Edouard Philippe presented to the National Assembly on Tuesday afternoon his plan to stop all sporting activity in the country until September.  Therefore, that will see the end of the Ligue 1 and Ligue 2 seasons.  When the league returns to action in September, it will do so with the beginning of the 2020-21 campaign.  The LFP has not yet decided on promotion and relegation however.  That decision will be made at a league meeting next month.  Also on the agenda will be if reigning champions Paris Saint-Germain, 12 points clear at the top of Ligue 1, will retain their crown.  The French top-flight was targeting a mid-June return with players set to begin returning to training on May 11.  However this latest development means there will be no top-flight action in France this summer, while other European leagues are fighting to salvage their seasons.  Premier League clubs, including Arsenal and Tottenham, have returned to training this week as discussions continue over a restart date in England.  June 8 has been reported as a potential start date for the Premier League.  English professional football has been suspended since March 13, with the Premier League and the English Football League keeping a restart date under “constant review”.  The Italian football federation (FIGC) will hold a meeting of its executive council on May 8 to present its plans to a government scientific committee.  Meanwhile, UEFA is releasing £203 million to national associations affected by the coronavirus pandemic.  European football’s governing body confirmed the money is part of the HatTrick funding, with each association will receiving up to £3.75 millio.

The Unprecedented Ozone Hole Over The Arctic Has Closed Up  28 Apr 2020, 17:01 by Tom Hale  The unprecedented Northern Hemisphere hole in the ozone layer has closed up after a month of lurking above the Arctic.  However, this is no reason for humanity to start popping the champagne. The unusual ozone hole (and its recovery) had little to do with human activity or even changes in pollution levels from the Covid-19 lockdown, but a freakishly strong polar vortex around the North Pole.  Scientists from Copernicus Atmosphere Monitoring Service (CAMS) used data from multiple ozone observations satellites to confirm that the “unprecedented 2020 northern hemisphere #OzoneHole has come to an end,” according to an announcement on Twitter on April 23.  “Although it looks like the polar vortex has not quite come to an end yet and will reform in the next few days, ozone values will not go back to the very low levels seen earlier in April,” they added .  The ozone layer is a region of the stratosphere between 15 and 30 kilometers (9.3 to 18.6 miles) above Earth's surface that has a high concentration of the gas ozone compared to other parts of the atmosphere. It effectively acts as a shield for our plant, absorbing much of the Sun's harmful ultraviolet rays.     When you hear “hole in the ozone layer,” you most likely think about the ozone hole over the Antarctic in the South Pole. Scientists first documented the hole in 1985 and it quickly became associated with certain human-made chemicals, especially manufactured refrigerants and solvents, that can act as ozone-depleting substances after they are transported up into the stratosphere. Thanks to a huge global effort, called the Montreal Protocol , the hole in the ozone layer over the Antarctic is the smallest its been in decades .  The recent situation in the North Pole, however, is a little different. While we expect to see natural variations in the ozone layer with the changing of the seasons, March 2020 brought something much more extreme than usual.  According to CAMS , the ozone hole was first opened over the Arctic in mid to late March after an unusually strong polar vortex, a low-pressure area that results in a wide expanse of swirling cold air. This trapped exceptional cold air in the North Pole for several weeks in a row and led to the formation of polar stratospheric clouds, high altitude clouds that can help to increase the chemical reactions involving the human-made chemicals that lead to ozone depletion once sunlight returns to the area. The result was dramatically dropping levels of ozone in the stratosphere in what became one of the largest ozone holes ever recorded over the Arctic.  “From my point of view, this is the first time you can speak about a real ozone hole in the Arctic,” Martin Dameris, an atmospheric scientist at the German Aerospace Center in Oberpfaffenhofen, told Nature in late March.  Now, it appears the polar vortex is starting to break down, allowing ozone-depleted air to mix around with ozone-rich air from lower latitudes. Since April 20, NASA's Ozone Watch has show notable levels of ozone returning to the Arctic pole, and the stratosphere is starting to appear how you'd expect it to look during a typical April.	News
Patients with blood and lung cancers are three times more at risk of dying of coronavirus than people with other tumors, study finds  28 Apr 2020, 17:02 by Mary Kekatos Senior Health Reporter For Dailymail.com    Researchers looked at coronavirus patients with multiple forms of cancer in comparison with coronavirus patients without tumors    People with blood and lung cancers were at a three-times greater risk of dying from the virus compared patients with other tumors    Blood cancers, in particular, attack the immune system and leave people more prone to severe infection and death    Cancer patients with the virus were more likely to be admitted to intensive care units or need mechanical ventilation than non-cancer patients     Here’s how to help people impacted by Covid-19     Patients with certain cancers are at a greater risk of dying from the novel coronavirus compared to those with other cancers, a new study suggests.  Researchers found that people with blood and lung cancers are three times more likely to die from the virus compared patients with other tumors.  Additionally, cancer patients - in comparison to those without cancer - were more likely to be admitted to intensive care units or need mechanical ventilation.  The team, led by Zhongnan Hospital of Wuhan University, says the findings could  help doctors closely monitor any patients with cancer so they can properly treat them as soon as they test positive and reduce the risk of them being hospitalized.    A new study has found that people with blood and lung cancers are three times more likely to die from coronavirus compared patients with other tumors (above)     Also at highest risk: people with cancer at stage IV, which means the cancer has spread to other organs or parts of the body (above in regards to lung cancer)     Cancer patients - in comparison to those without cancer - were more likely to be admitted to intensive care units or need mechanical ventilation (above)   For the study, published in the online journal American Association for Cancer Research - Cancer Discovery , the team looked at patients from 14 hospitals in Wuhan, China - where the virus originated.  Data came from 105 cancer patients and 536 patients who didn't have cancer -all of whom were the same age and had coronavirus.  Risk factors included the type of cancer, the stage the cancer was in and treatment patients were receiving such as chemotherapy.  Unsurprisingly, cancer patients with coronavirus were at higher risk of being admitted to the ICU, having at least severe symptom or need to go on a ventilator.  However, those with blood and lung cancer at any stage were more likely to die from COVID-19, the disease caused by the virus, than those with other cancer.  Also at highest risk: people with cancer at stage IV, which means the cancer has spread to other organs or parts of the body.  In regards to treatment, patients undergoing immunotherapy and surgery had higher risks of  have developing critical symptoms and death compared to other therapies.  Only radiotherapy did not show significant differences in so-called 'severe events' in comparison with people without cancer.  COVID-19 patients with cancer also had a longer average stay in the hospital at 27 days compared to about 18 days for coronavirus patients without cancer.  'These findings indicate that cancer patients appear more vulnerable to SARS-COV-2 outbreak,' the authors wrote.    Blood cancers, in particular, attack the immune system and leave people more prone to severe infection and death. Pictured: A nurse feeds a COVID-19 patient at Stamford Hospital's ICU in Stamford, Connecticut, April 24         'Since this is the first large cohort study on this topic, our report will provide the much-needed information that will benefit global cancer patients.'  It's not clear why people with blood cancers have higher death rates, but the team suggests these patients have more compromised immune systems than patients with solid tumors.  Additionally, cancers including leukemia, lymphoma and myeloma attack the immune system, which reduces the number of immune cells and make people more prone to severe infection and death.  These patients also are typically older, which is another risk factor.  In the US, there are currently more than 1.01 million confirmed cases of the virus and more than 56,000 deaths.       Experts don't know whether patients can become immune from Covid-19    RELATED ARTICLES	News
‘13 workers died of silicosis in Gujarat in 16 months’  The data was released by Peoples Training and Research Centre (PTRC), an NGO working for occupational health on Tuesday to mark International Workers’ Memorial Day (IWMD).  28 Apr 2020, 17:32 by Express News Service  As many as 13 workers died of silicosis in the last 16 months in Gujarat while 168 workers were killed in industrial accidents between November 2018 and November 2019, Peoples Training and Research Centre (PTRC), an NGO working for occupational health, said on Tuesday.  “Diagnosis of occupational disease in the country must be happening, but official data of such diagnosis are scarcely made public. However, 13 persons died due to silicosis from the group of workers we have been working with in Gujarat between January, 2019 and April 2020. They include seven workers working in ceramic factories in Thangadh, three sculptors of Dhrangadhra, one worker in tile industry of Morbi and two from Rajkot district,” Jagdish Patel, director of PTRC said in a release issued on Tuesday on the occasion of International Workers’ Memorial Day (IWMD).  IWMD is observed on April 28 to pay tribute to those workers who die due to occupational diseases and in industrial accidents as well as to demand better working environment for workers.  Thangadh town in Surendranagar is a hub of factories producing ceramic sanitary ware products while Dhrangadhra, also in Surendranagar district, is known for sculptors who make idols from stones.  “We have recorded 28 deaths since 2016 in three districts of Surendranagar, Morbi and Rajkot. Of them, 21 have been recorded in Surendranagar, four in Rajkot and three in Morbi. The 21 deaths in Surendranagar include 16 ceramic workers of Thangadh and five sculptors of Dhrangadhra,” Patel told The Indian Express .  The workers who died in Rajkot included those who had worked in marble industry in Rajasthan and ceramic industry of Surendranagar.  “As per our records, there are 70 workers who have developed silicosis in these three districts. Surendranagar accounts for bulk of them with Thangadh having 25 active cases, Dhrangadhra 22 and three in other parts of the district. Rajkot and Morbi have 12 and eight cases respectively,” the PTRC director further said.  The PTRC release also said that total 168 workers lost their lives to industrial accidents in the state between November 2018 and November, 2019. Patel said that 19 more workers were killed in three major industrial accidents the state in the first two months of this year.  Apart from this, 218 workers have died in the state from January 2018 to November 2019. “According to departmental information (provided by Gujarat government), 17.25 lakh workers were employed in 32,192 units registered in Gujarat and having establishments in the state in 2018 but of them, 263 workers died in fatal accidents,” the PTRC release further said.  “According to these figures, the rate of fatalities in accidents is 15.23 per one lakh workers. It was merely 1.65 in 28 member countries of European Union in 2017. It shows that we have a long way to go in providing safe working place to our workers,” said Patel.  The PTRC also demanded that during the COVID-19  pandemic , Clinical Establishment Act, 2010 should be implemented in Gujarat.  © The Indian Express (P) Ltd	News

McDonald’s carries out tests in preparation to reopen restaurants   28 Apr 2020, 10:37    The fast-food chain closed all of its restaurants last month in the face of the coronavirus pandemic.     People queued at McDonald's before the lockdown was established   The UK boss of McDonald’s has said the restaurant chain is carrying out tests behind closed doors this week in preparation for reopening sites.  The fast-food chain closed all of its restaurants last month in the face of the coronavirus pandemic.  Rivals such as Burger King and KFC have reopened their first sites for delivery and takeaway over the past week.  Paul Pomroy, McDonald’s chief executive officer for UK and Ireland, said it decided to close its restaurants temporarily for “the safety of our people and customers” but has recently begun looking at a “potential and limited reopening”.     The restaurant chain said it is engaging with government and trade bodies, as well as listening to employees and customers, to ensure sites are opened “when the time is right”.  Mr Pomroy said the business is “carrying out some operational tests to explore what our reopening might look like” throughout this week.  He said the tests will include exploring social distancing measures for staff, PPE options and opening in a limited capacity.    Could people soon be able to visit McDonald's for take out and drive-thru orders   McDonald’s provided no details regarding when it intends to re-open its first restaurants for orders from the public.  Mr Pomroy added: “Restarting our business is not an easy task even when reopening in a limited capacity.  “We have set ourselves some key criteria for reopening, all of which take time – first and foremost ensuring the wellbeing of our people and creating the right environment for them to return to work; secondly ensuring we have enough supply of fresh produce; and finally working in step with government guidelines to ensure the safety of our customers.  “For now we remain closed, and will only reopen when we are absolutely confident we can have the right measures in place to ensure everyone’s wellbeing.”	News

Coronavirus lockdown | Explain Home Ministry order on full wages, Supreme Court tells government  Bench asks Centre to reply in two weeks.  28 Apr 2020, 19:11 by Legal Correspondent  The Supreme Court has given the Centre two weeks to explain a Ministry of Home Affairs (MHA) order, issued on March 29, directing employers to pay full wages to their workers during the lockdown.  A three-judge Bench, led by Justice N.V. Ramana, on Monday, allowed Solicitor-General Tushar Mehta, appearing for the government, to file his response to a batch of petitions filed by several companies challenging the constitutional validity of the March 29 order, which mandates that industry, shops and commercial establishments, without exception, pay their workers without any deduction in the name of COVID-19 . The petitions said a blanket direction to private establishments to pay full salaries against no work was arbitrary and violative of Article 14 (right to equality) of the Constitution.

An employer and employee have reciprocal promises whereby the right of an employee to demand salary is reciprocal to performance of work by such employee. The employer has a right to not pay if no work is done,” the petition filed by private firms such as Nagreeka Exports Limited and Ficus Pax Private Ltd. said.  Nagreeka said it was engaged in manufacture and export of cotton yarns, fabric and textiles. It said stoppage of operations since the lockdown had led to losses to the tune of ₹1.50 crore.

These petitions have asked the court to order the government to support them by taking responsibility for 70% of their staffers’ pay by drawing funds from the PM Cares Fund or the Employees State Insurance Corporation.

"Coronavirus vaccine before the end of 2021 would be 'nothing short of a miracle', expert warns  He claimed that developing a vaccine before the end of next year was the ""most optimistic of scenarios""  28 Apr 2020, 07:42 by Sam Roberts, Neil Leslie  A coronavirus vaccine being developed before the end of 2021 would be ""nothing short of a miracle"", an expert has warned.  Pasi Penttinen from the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control said that even a two year timeline would be a challenge.  He claimed that developing a vaccine before the end of next year was the ""most optimistic of scenarios"".  He told Sky News: ""Vaccine development is a hugely complicated and expensive process, you need to go through human trials in phases one, two and three to make sure the vaccines are effective and safe.  ""And on top of that you need to make sure in that kind of situation that manufacturing capacity is essentially sufficient for the whole world, so having a one year, two year timeline to get that done is nothing short of a miracle.""     It comes after Ireland's top doctor said a decision on easing lockdown next week will go “down to the wire.”  Dr Tony Holohan said that the level of Covid-19 is not yet where it needs to be for him to give the green light to lift restrictions.  And the Chief Medical Officer warned that Ireland still risks seeing the same carnage as Italy, Spain and the US if the disease spirals out of control again.  He was speaking after confirming 18 more people lost their lives, bringing the death toll to 1,102. Infections rose by 386 cases to 19,648.  It was revealed that 10 deaths have occurred in residential centres for people with disabilities.  A total of 614 deaths have occurred across the care sector with 546 in nursing homes.  The National Public Health Emergency team will decide on Friday whether to recommend easing restrictions on a range of social and economic activity based on the level of risk they pose.  It is likely there will be no major shift in strategy on May 5th. However, a blueprint of how to lift lockdown measures and in what order is expected this week. Dr Holohan repeated that if yesterday was the May 5th deadline there would be no change in restrictions.  “I am more firmly of that view,” he said. “Hopefully as the week goes on we will continue to see improvements.     (Image: Collins)    “The trends are encouraging but we need to see further progress. We understand there has been frustration. We want to encourage people to continue to work with us.  “It is down to the wire. I haven’t made my mind up and I am only one voice. We will have a discussion tomorrow and wait as long as possible.”  The CMO then issued a dire warning on coming out of lockdown too soon.  “We have done great work together as a country in terms of preventing the widespread community transmission of this virus that could have led to the kinds of scenes we saw in many European cities and in North America,” he said.  “We have managed to avoid that. We could quite easily slip back into that kind of risk.”   Read More"	News
Leaders have fleeced us dry; stop them! We deserve human dignity  28 Apr 2020 by JOACHIM BUWEMBO    In Summary    It is not for being brainless that we pay twice or thrice than the rich countries for infrastructure projects; it is because we are hostages of criminally minded officials.    Even before this coronavirus outbreak is concluded one way or another, Africans have certainly learnt a thing or two.  We are now sure that some people on other continents do not hold us in very high regard. This is a very good thing. It could be the rude awakening that we needed.  Before we go hankering for acceptance and approval from the rest of the world, we at least have a clearer idea of our starting point in their eyes.  There were many examples that testified to the low opinions and biases held against the African, which must have jolted some Africans working overseas where they seem to be treated with respect.  Covid-19 came with tension and deep opinions harboured by some people.  The most bemusing reactions for many of us was in China, of all places, to Africans who were regarded as high suspects in harbouring the coronavirus.  Also Read       AKINYEMI: In these strange times, stay centred and focused       NERIMA: Tough times call for action on cheaper commodities, safety       MUMBA: Afforestation vital in making Africa climate resilient    Advertisement  Africans should be very happy about this, for now they know their place, or more clearly, the place ascribed to them in many minds out there. That should be enough motivation to refocus our efforts and attitudes in whatever we do, and strive to make our so-called independence a reality.  It is not that people on other continents hate us. No! It is our public officials that have created the impression that we are unserious and unreliable. I recall in 2012 I was coordinating a project sensitising and mentoring journalists from many African countries which led me to cross the length and breadth of our great continent.  I helped a journalist write a project plan to create an information portal for political and economic insights on his country. He approached several foreign missions in his capital with the sample and all senior diplomats he met agreed it was great. But a few sincere ones told him that to subscribe to it would cost more money than they usually spend to buy information from senior government officials.  It could take two or three generations to change that impression if we start working on it right now. For we know that we are not as daft as what our public officials have led the world to think we are. And it is not for making outsiders think better of us, but for us to better utilise our human and natural resources.  It is not for being brainless that we pay twice or thrice than the rich countries for infrastructure projects; it is because we are hostages of criminally minded officials who routinely collude with contractors to fleece us and stunt our economies.  It is not for being mentally retarded that we borrow for projects whose actual implementation cost equals the counter-fund that our governments put down before the external donor ‘gives’ the loan; it is due to the inattentiveness of officials who ‘negotiate’ (of course they negotiate their commissions) on behalf of the African countries.  It is not for genetic inferiority complex that many in our populations wear second hand garments down to undergarments even as we have the best conditions for growing cotton; it is the unpatriotic officials who pursue policies that kill or stunt African textile and garment industries.  It is not out ignorance that we spend billions in whatever currency on public education as individual parents pay millions to private schools because they see no value for money in the schools where their taxes are spent; it is because of big officials who have recruited smaller officials all the way down to the school into their corruption rackets.  It is not a suicidal streak that makes us spend billions on health sectors but fail to stock and equip public hospitals, then spend billions of dollars taking a few patients abroad, selecting the beneficiaries under extremely untransparent criteria; it is some officials who have constituted themselves into illegal medical referrals committees that make the decisions.  It is not that we hate our children that we have sold off the school playgrounds in most African capitals to investors for setting up fuel stations, garages and car washing bays; it is a few of us whose children study abroad that make such decisions.  As Africans we need to stop and reverse this leadership decay if we are to win basic human dignity for our people. And it is not to win the respect of those who despise us; we need to do it to secure the wellbeing of our next generation.   Joachim Buwembo is a Kampala-based journalist.

"US FDA says steps needed to stop people drinking hand sanitizer   28 Apr 2020, 00:21   REUTERS: The US Food and Drug Administration on Monday (Apr 27) asked manufacturers of hand sanitizers to add denatured alcohol to the products in order to make them less palatable in a bid to discourage people, especially children, from drinking the liquid.  The regulator's advisory follows US President Donald Trump's recent comments on whether injecting disinfectants might treat COVID-19, which raised concerns that frightened people could poison themselves with untested treatments.  ""Hand sanitizers are not proven to treat COVID-19, and like other products meant for external use, are not for ingestion, inhalation, or intravenous use,"" FDA Commissioner Stephen Hahn said in a statement.    Food and Drug Administration (FDA) Commissioner Dr Stephen Hahn addresses the daily coronavirus task force briefing at the White House in Washington, DC. (REUTERS/Jonathan Ernst)   Demand for hand sanitizers has soared after the government and health agencies advised people to clean their hands thoroughly to discourage the spread of the new coronavirus, which has caused over 51,000 deaths in the United States.  The agency said adding denatured alcohol to hand sanitizers renders a bitter taste making the liquid less appealing for consumption.  Calls to the National Poison Data System last month related to hand sanitizer increased by 79 per cent compared to March 2019, and a majority of them were about unintentional exposure to children aged 5 and younger, the FDA said.  The agency recommended that the products carry child safety warnings and information to get medical help upon accidental consumption.  The FDA, which in March relaxed rules to allow pharmacists to supply alcohol-based hand sanitizers without prescriptions, also said it was taking measures to help ensure continued supply of the product.  More than 1,500 new makers of alcohol-based hand sanitizers have registered with the agency as it works to improve the safety and supply of the product amid the COVID-19 pandemic, the agency said.

"Coronavirus crisis | Govt to revise Budget projections soon, FY2020-21 expected to be a non-event  It is becoming increasingly difficult for the government to rework the fiscal math as there is no clarity on when the economy will resume completely  28 Apr 2020 by Kamalika Ghosh  The financial year 2020-21 is expected to be a non-event, even if there isn't technically what is understood as a recession, a senior government official said.  ""There's no point anymore of the targets set in the Budget. COVID-19 is a global reality and not just India, projections of all economies is nothing anymore,"" the official told Moneycontrol .  Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman in her 2020-21 Budget, pegged fiscal deficit target for 2020-21 at 3.5 percent of gross domestic product (GDP). But in a recent interview, RBI Governor Shaktikanta Das pointed out that FY21 fiscal gap going beyond 3.5 percent has become unavoidable  Real GDP growth was pegged at 6 to 6.5 percent for 2020-21 by the Economic Survey 2019-20. The Budget estimated the Centre’s total expenditure at Rs 30.4 lakh crore. Proceeds from gross tax revenue were estimated at Rs 24.23 lakh crore, and the divestment target for the year was set at Rs 2.12 lakh crore.  ""Fiscal deficit, GDP projections, everything will have to be relooked at. We are doing our own assessments. But a final figure would be announced only when the actual impact of this (COVID-19) can be ascertained,"" the official said.  Giving a timeline by when the government would announce its revised projections for the year would be difficult as it would not be possible to arrive at any estimation without knowing by when the economy is able to resume completely, the official said.  The International Monetary Fund (IMF) on April 14 slashed growth forecast for the Indian economy, projecting a GDP growth of 1.9 percent in 2020. This comes at a time when the global economy has hit the worst recession as a result of the collapse in economic activity due to the coronavirus-induced lockdown.  On April 27, India Ratings and Research (Ind-Ra) revised its FY21 economic growth forecast for the country further down to 1.9 percent, lowest in the last 29 years, citing the COVID-19 pandemic and the subsequent lockdown.  According to Ind-Ra, Indian economy had registered a GDP growth of 1.1 percent in the financial year 1991-92.  Ind-Ra revised its economic growth estimate for the country from its forecast of 3.6 percent published on March 30, 2020, to 1.9 percent.  Ind-Ra noted that its growth projection is based on the assumption that the partial lockdown will continue till mid-May 2020.  According to Ind-Ra, ""GDP may come back to the fourth quarter of 2019-20 fiscal level only by the third quarter (October-December) of current 2020-21 fiscal anticipating resumption of normal economic activities during the second quarter (July-September) of 2020-21 and festive demand during the third quarter of current fiscal (October-December),"" it said.  The rating agency said on the fiscal front, the dip in tax/non-tax revenue due to the lockdown, growth slowdown coupled with the need to provide fiscal stimulus will destabilise the fiscal arithmetic of both union and state governments.

"World awaits opening of Grand Egyptian Museum  28 Apr 2020 by Mustafa Marie  CAIRO - 28 April 2020: Under the title ""You will not have to wait to see King Tut in the Grand Egyptian Museum"", the American magazine Forbes shed light on the virtual tours organized by Egypt’s Ministry of Tourism and Antiquities. Forbes mentioned that museum lovers had to postpone visits to the Grand Egyptian Museum until the end of the COVID-19 epidemic. The American magazine highlighted that the museum’s opening was one of the most anticipated international art events in 2020. The famed magazine pointed out that while the museum’s opening was postponed until early 2021, the Egyptian Ministry of Tourism and Antiquities is offering virtual tours on Instagram to the most prominent monuments around the country, where one can tour archaeological sites such as the tomb of Miho in Saqqara and the Pyramid of Djoser as well as many museum exhibitions. The magazine added that for the lovers of ancient Egypt, the opening of the Grand Egyptian Museum is worth the wait, explaining that the prominent billion-dollar landmark includes artifacts collected by Howard Carter from the tomb of King Tutankhamen in 1922, in addition to thousands of treasures that had not been showcased before. Furthermore, the magazine pointed out that the enormous size of the museum (50,000 square meters) means that visitors may have to set aside more than half a day that most tour operators are currently devoting to the Tahrir Museum in Cairo, where Tutankhamun's treasure once existed. Although the remains of King Tut have been transferred to the Grand Egyptian Museum, the Egyptian Museum in Tahrir, which was built in 1902, many years before the discovery of Tut, will remain a gem in itself. In addition, the magazine pointed out that the tour operators deal creatively with the postponement of the opening of the Grand Egyptian Museum and the reopening of other Egyptian sites, where visitors will have the opportunity to stand between the feet of the Sphinx, listen to a lecture and dine with Tawfik, the man who supervised the construction and planning stages for the new museum complex.

"Irrfan Khan admitted to Mumbai hospital ICU with colon infection  The 53-year-old, who is at the Kokilaben Dhirubhai Ambani Hospital, lost his 95-year-old mother Saeeda Begum in Jaipur just three days ago.  28 Apr 2020 by PTI  Actor Irrfan Khan, who was diagnosed with a rare form of cancer in 2018, has been admitted to the intensive care unit of a city hospital with a colon infection, his spokesperson said on Tuesday.

Tara Reade claims reinforce Biden's 'creeper' image, undercut campaign  28 Apr 2020 by Seth McLaughlin  A decades-old accusation that won’t go away is making it hard for former Vice President Joseph R. Biden to shed his “Creepy Uncle Joe” image as he prepares to become the 2020 Democratic standard-bearer against President Trump .  Mr. Biden denies former Senate staffer Tara Reade ’s claim that he pinned her up against a wall and sexually assaulted her in 1993 when he was a senator from Delaware. But the story persists and more people have come forward to vouch for Ms. Reade ’s tale of violation and humiliation at the hands of Mr. Biden .  “The Tara Reade allegations are a problem, but I think their tangible, lasting effect will be to open the door to persistent and routine consideration of Vice President Biden ’s more generic, more pervasive problem of just being a creeper,” said Mike McKenna , a GOP strategist who recently left his post as deputy director of legislative affairs at the White House. “As a practical matter, that will serve to neutralize the president’s challenges in the same portion of the human experience.”  For Mr. Trump , who also has weathered accusations of being too handsy with women, the Reade accusations provide an opportunity to shift attention away from the coronavirus crisis that has become the defining issue of 2020.  For Mr. Biden , it could jeopardize his strong support among the female voters that are crucial to his chances of winning in November.  On Tuesday, Mr. Biden did not field questions from the press and did not address the Reade accusation Tuesday during a virtual “Women’s Town Hall” event at which Hillary Clinton endorsed him.  “Just think of what a difference it would make right now if we had a president who not only listened to the science, put facts over fiction, but brought us together — showed the kind of compassion and caring that we need from our president and which Joe Biden has been exemplifying his entire life,” said Mrs. Clinton , the failed 2016 Democratic presidential nominee.   Dogged by allegations — new and old   Before he formally entered the 2020 presidential race, Lucy Flores, a former Nevada assemblywoman, came forward to accuse Mr. Biden of putting his hands on her shoulders, smelling her hair and kissing the back of her head without permission in 2014.   Others came forward, including Ms. Reade . She said last spring that Mr. Biden ’s touching made her feel uncomfortable when she worked in his office.  Ms. Reade took her accusation further last month, relaying a story on the Katie Halper Show podcast of how Mr. Biden pinned her up against a wall at the Capitol in 1993 and sexually penetrated her with his fingers.  “Women have a right to tell their story, and reporters have an obligation to rigorously vet those claims,” Biden campaign spokesperson Kate Bedingfield said in a statement earlier this month. “We encourage them to do so because these accusations are false.”  Biden supporters also dismissed Ms. Reade for having political motivations because she backed Sen. Bernard Sanders’ run for the Democratic presidential nomination. The criticism evaporated when Mr. Sanders dropped out of the race on April 8 and Ms. Reade continued to tell her story.   Tara Reade pushes forward   Things escalated Tuesday after Ms. Reade called on the Biden campaign to release more records from the 36 years he spent the Senate.  “I’m calling for the release of the documents being held by the University of Delaware that contain Biden ’s staff personnel records because I believe it will have my complaint form, as well as my separation letter and other documents,” Ms. Reade told Fox News.  “Maybe if other staffers that have tried to file complaints would come to light. Why are they under seal? And why won’t they be released to the public?” she said.  The demand came after Business Insider reported this week Ms. Reade had shared her story at the time with a Lynda LaCassa, a neighbor, and Lorraine Sanchez, who worked with Ms. Reade for California state Sen. Jack O’Connell from 1994 to 1996.  “I remember her saying, here was this person that she was working for — and she idolized him,” Ms. LaCassa said in the report. “He kind of put her up against a wall, and he put his hand up her skirt and he put his fingers inside her. She felt like she was assaulted, and she really didn’t feel there was anything she could do.”  Days earlier, video footage from 1993 was unearthed in which it appears a woman whom Ms. Reade identifies as her mother calls into CNN’s “Larry King Live” show seeking advice on what her daughter, who had recently left her post working for a “prominent senator,” should do to report her “problems.”  The caller neither identified herself nor mentioned Mr. Biden or sexual assault.   Pressure mounts   Mr. Biden is facing mounting calls to address the accusation more directly.  David Sirota, who served as a speechwriter and senior adviser to Sen. Bernard Sanders’ 2020 bid, said Mr. Biden “needs to answer questions about the sexual assault allegations.”  “I don’t know why this is hard for anyone to agree with,” Mr. Sirota said on Twitter this week. “If you’ve spent the last few years publicly insisting that we must take such allegations seriously, this shouldn’t be hard for you to agree with.”  Shaun King, another Sanders surrogate, said the accusations that surfaced last year that he “touched, petted, stroked, smelled or kissed” nearly a dozen different women “should’ve ended his candidacy.”  “I literally think he was the ONLY Democratic candidate with this history,” Mr. King said.  More broadly, the new accusation has fed into a broader debate over whether the Democrats and activists in the #MeToo movement that were quick to try to torpedo Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh’s nomination to the high court in 2018 with unproven and less-corroborated accusations of teenage sexual misconduct have been exposed as hypocrites.  Weighing in around that time, Mr. Biden said a women’s claims about sexual assault should be presumed to be true.  “For a woman to come forward in the flaring lights of focus, nationally, you’ve got to start off with the presumption that at least the essence of what she’s talking about is real, whether or not she forgets facts, whether or not it’s been made worse or better over time,” he said. “But nobody fails to understand that this is like jumping into a cauldron.”  Actress Alyssa Milano, who was a vocal Kavanaugh critic and has defended Mr. Biden , softened her stance Tuesday after previously downplaying Ms. Reade ’s charge.  “I’m aware of the new developments in Tara Reade ’s accusation against Joe Biden ,” she said. “I want Tara , like every other survivor, to have the space to be heard and seen without being used as fodder. I hear and see you, Tara . #MeToo”   Trump campaign pounces   The Trump campaign has signaled the accusations against Mr. Biden are fair game.  His camp blasted out a PBS interview this week on social media in which Mr. Biden was asked about the #MeToo Movement, and said: “Women should be believed.”  They posed another clip of Fox News host Tucker Carlson pointing out that Democrats set a clear standard during the Kavanaugh hearings: That they always believe women.  Trump campaign spokesman Ken Farnaso said there is “no doubt a double standard” exists.  “It comes as no surprise that the Democrats and mainstream media have given Joe Biden a pass on his sexual assault allegations,” Mr. Farnaso said. “It’s baffling that nearly everyone in American politics has been asked for a reaction to this except Joe Biden himself. Is he off-limits?”  The campaign also posted a photograph of Mr. Biden grinning ear to ear in a photograph alongside former President Bill Clinton that it identified as being from 1993 — the year of the Reade accusations.  Mr. Clinton became the focus of Mr. Trump ’s attacks in 2016 when he marched out some of the women who had accused Mr. Clinton of sexual misconduct as an attack on Mrs. Clinton’s campaign.  Mr. McKenna said the line of attacks could have its limits.  “There exists within the Trump team a sotto voce but durable conversation about the allocation of time and resources spent attacking the other guy versus defending the record,” Mr. McKenna said. “At a certain point, incumbents have to defend the record.”	NotNews
"Schools safe, Christchurch experts says   28 Apr 2020   It is as safe as it has ever been for children to attend school, a Christchurch infectious disease expert says.  Christchurch-based infectious diseases and public health specialist Prof Philip Hill and paediatrician and infectious diseases researcher Associate Prof Tony Walls, of Otago University, say the lack of Covid-19 circulating in our community, fewer other viruses and bacteria than usual, and good systems for detection and contact tracing, meant parents should feel comfortable about sending their children back to school this week.  A new study in Australia looking at children exposed to Covid-19 in a school setting also supports this view.  Assoc Prof Walls said many parents would be asking themselves how safe it was to be sending their children back to school.  ""The answer is, sending your children to school is as safe as it’s ever been.""  He said overseas evidence showed while children could be infected with Covid-19, they seldom became sick enough to need to go to hospital, and were not the main spreaders of infection in communities.  But Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern said alert level 3 was recovery room and didn't mean New Zealand was ""out of the woods"".  She said there may still be some ""smouldering ashes"" of Covid-19, and they had the potential to become a wildfire again if given the chance.  ""We must continue to stay home if possible. No one wants a second wave in New Zealand,"" she said.  Schools and ECE centres will open tomorrow, but Ardern said the numbers of returning students was going to be ""very low"". ""That's as it should be.""  Ardern's media address follows director-general of health Ashley Bloomfield announcing three new Covid-19 cases in NZ, made up of two confirmed cases and one probable case.  A recent study in Australia tested contacts of teachers and children who tested positive for Covid-19.  Only two infections were transferred among 863 close contacts in schools where the 18 cases occurred.  No child-to-child transmissions occurred in primary schools. The only child infected at primary school got it from their teacher, the study reported.  Assoc Prof Walls said data from Covid-19 hot spots confirmed the lower risk of children as carriers and patients.  Prof Hill said Singapore had successfully controlled the spread of Covid-19 while allowing children to attend school. There had not been any outbreaks among children.  ""It just doesn’t make sense to say this virus spreads widely in schools when there have been very few children affected in other countries where schools have been open.""  He said nobody could say children would not get influenza or some other viral infection at school.  ""The best protection for everyone in a school is to keep children and adults away from school if they are unwell, and to encourage everyone to wash their hands regularly during the day.""   john.lewis@odt.co.nz"	News
8 Ways to Train Your Mind to Succeed During Uncertain Times  Alireza Kohany explain... Being an entrepreneur is not just about creativity and ambition – it's also having the right mindset to make things happen.  28 Apr 2020 by Alireza Kohany  If your mind is reeling with tons of potential business ideas but you never find the courage to turn them into reality, or if you’re already mid-venture and find you doubt yourself more often than not, it might be time to work on your approach to how you do business during these uncertain times.  Being an entrepreneur is not just about creativity and ambition – it’s also having the right mindset to make things happen. Luckily, there are ways in which you can train your mind to be more successful in all things business.   Swap fear for curiosity If there was a job description for an entrepreneur, venturing into the unknown would definitely be a part of it. For many, this is a scary prospect – you’re exploring areas of business in which you have no solid experience. If you’re lucky (and really good at what you do), you might even be the first person to consider doing things this way.   If the fear of taking too big a risk or making unpopular decisions is getting in the way, think of it as curiosity and exploration instead. Whenever you’re feeling anxious, tell yourself you’re just curious as to what the end result will be. This will make you more open to experimentation and give you more courage to try new things.   Do things that scare you Once a day, if you can manage it. Take risks, big and small, as often as you can. This will train your mind to be more resistant to the stress that usually comes with risk, and serve as a reminder that most of the time, nothing all that terrible will happen if you fail. There’s no need to be reckless – but there’s every reason to be decisive and confident in your decisions.  Learn to trust your gut The ability to think fast and be decisive in the right moments can make or break your business career. The good news is, more often than not, your first instinct will be the best guide to making a quick decision. The only challenge is learning to trust that instinct.   The best way to do that is to practice, on both big and small decisions. Whenever you’re faced with a choice, pay attention to what your instinct is telling you – and act on it. Soon enough, you’ll see that it won’t lead you astray and learn to trust it.   Appreciate yourself Planning ahead and having firmly set goals is incredibly important, but so is recognizing how far you’ve already come. Take a moment every day to assess the progress you’ve made and appreciate yourself for following through with your business goals and ideas.   Even if things didn’t go exactly to plan, every perceived failure is a learning experience – so at the end of every day, there’s always going to be something for which to feel grateful and successful.   Recognize your success in the present It’s a good idea to stay focused on your end goal. However, if you’re always thinking about your success as something far off in the distance, you’ll always feel like you’re not doing enough to reach it.   Rather than thinking of your success in the future tense, try to consider it in the present in your mind. Instead of thinking, ‘one day, I’ll make it happen’, think: ‘I’m already making it happen’. And it’s perfectly true – every day spent working on your goal is a part of the success you’re aiming for.   Learn to ask for what you want Asking for what you want or need – especially if you don’t think you’re likely to get it – can be tough at first. It’s important to overcome this particular hurdle, though, and start being direct about your expectations.   For instance, decide on your prices based on what you want to earn, rather than what you think others will be willing to pay. Of course, you still need to be realistic with your expectations, but don’t sell yourself short. Even if it takes a while, you will eventually start getting what you ask for – along with a serious confidence boost.   Exercise and stay healthy It’s more than a self-help cliché: a healthy, well-nourished body fosters healthy thinking. Try to exercise regularly – it’ll not only help to keep your stress levels in check, but also give you productive time away from work.   Improving your physical condition will improve your confidence, and that’s also massively important for achieving a successful business mindset. A healthy diet to go alongside the exercise plan will have you feeling less tired and ready to take on the mental and physical challenges of running a successful business.   Seek out positive reinforcement, cut out the nay-sayers All human beings are impressionable to some degree. And whatever your venture or position, there will always be someone who tries to knock it. Of course, criticism can be constructive – but it can also be highly destructive and cause you to doubt yourself.   Surrounding yourself with supportive individuals – whether they’re friends, family, or professional advisors – will help you feel more confident and driven.  — Published on April 28, 2020   You might also like...

"Huawei Mate 40 Pro touted to feature a ""freeform"" lens for improved ultra-wide-angle camera performance  28 Apr 2020 by Ricci Rox   Huawei uses a massive 1/1.54"" sensor on its ultra-wide-angle shooters, but has been unable to pair it with a lens that can provide an industry-competitive field of view. Things are expected to change with the upcoming Mate 40 Pro, however, as a new leak claims the phone will sport a new, innovative lens type.   Huawei's mobile business has been stunted by the company's inability to use Google Services, but the company isn't looking to quit anytime soon. The Huawei P40 series was launched earlier this month, and a new leak has now given us our first look at Huawei's next flagship phone, the Mate 40 Pro.  Going by the leak, shared by popular leakster @RODENT950, the Mate 40 Pro will debut a new camera lens type. The phone is shown sporting what is obviously a periscope lens—a zoom lens that debuted in the smartphone market with the P30 Pro last year. The lens beside it is the interesting one, though, as it seems to be yet another periscope lens but isn't.  Reports from a few weeks ago claimed that Huawei would use a ""freeform"" lens. That's likely what that second lens is. A freeform lens is said to aid in reducing wide-angle distortion and offers a slimmer design. While Huawei uses the biggest sensors on its wide-angle shooters, that has come at the expense of a wider field of view.  Like with the Mate 30 Pro, Huawei implements a large and high-resolution image sensor (40MP 1/1.54″) in its ultra-wide camera, which combined with a fast f/1.8 lens, should make for excellent low-light image quality. The downside of such a large sensor in the ultra-wide is lens design. It’s a challenge to design a lens that provides a very wide angle of view and still fits into the thin body of a high-end smartphone. This is why Huawei settled on a compromise at 18mm, which is noticeably wider than the main camera, but not as wide as that of some competitors, such as the latest Samsung devices and iPhones, which offer 12mm and 13mm lenses, respectively. - DxOMark, Huawei P40 Pro Review  A freeform lens will likely allow Huawei to increase the field of view of its ultra-wide-angle shooter to more competitive levels.  The Mate 40 Pro is likely to be powered by the Kirin 1020. The next-gen SoC is expected to be built on TSMC's 5nm manufacturing process, and could feature Cortex-A78 cores.

"Taiwan pushes WHO participation in rare ministerial call with US   28 Apr 2020, 09:47   TAIPEI: In a rare teleconference between health ministers, Taiwan has thanked the United States for its support in pushing for the island's participation in the World Health Organization (WHO) amid the coronavirus pandemic and despite China's objections.  In turn the United States thanked Taiwan for sharing its medical best practices.   READ: Taiwan says WHO ignored its coronavirus questions at start of outbreak    READ: Taiwan condemns 'groundless' accusations it attacked WHO chief   Taiwan has limited the coronavirus outbreak to just 429 confirmed cases and six deaths.  Taiwan's lack of membership at the WHO, due to China's objections which considers the island merely one of its provinces, has infuriated Taipei, which says its exclusion has created a glaring gap in global fight against coronavirus.  In a teleconference late Monday (Apr 27), Taiwan Health Minister Chen Shih-chung thanked US Secretary of Health and Human Services Alex Azar ""for the strong support extended by the United States for Taiwan's participation in the WHO"", Taiwan's Health Ministry said in a statement.  ""Minister Chen told Secretary Azar that he hopes the US will continue to support for Taiwan's full participation in the World Health Assembly as observer and WHO meetings, mechanisms, and activities,"" the statement added.  The World Health Assembly is the WHO's decision-making body.  Taiwan attended it as an observer from 2009-2016 when Taipei-Beijing relations warmed, but China blocked further participation after the election of Taiwan President Tsai Ing-wen, who China views as a separatist, charges she rejects.   READ: Taiwan defence minister apologises after coronavirus outbreak on navy ship 7   Taiwan's Health Ministry said that Azar reaffirmed ""the continued and concrete support from the US of expanding Taiwan's participation in the WHO and global health arena"".  The WHO and China both say Taiwan has been given the access to and information it needs from the body during the pandemic, but Taiwan says that has been limited.  Azar, in a tweet, said he had thanked Chen for Taiwan's ""efforts to share their best practices and resources with the US"" ""Now, more than ever, global health partnership is crucial and I appreciate Taiwan's contributions.""  Direct, public interactions between ministerial-level officials from Taiwan and the United States are unusual as the two do not have official diplomatic ties.  The United States, like most countries, only has formal relations with Beijing, though it is Taiwan's strongest backer on the international stage.  Earlier this month Taiwan and the United States discussed how to get ""closer coordination"" between the island and the WHO during the coronavirus outbreak, drawing a rebuke from China for ""political manipulation"" of the epidemic.  US President Donald Trump signed a new law last month requiring increased support for Taiwan's international role. China threatened unspecified retaliation in response.  Taiwan has been far more successful than many of its neighbours keeping the virus in check thanks to early and stringent steps to control its spread.  Source: Reuters/ad"	News
Airbnb announces new cleaning protocols to help “the future of travel”  28 Apr 2020, 09:59 by Nic Ker  One of the hardest-hit industries, as far as the economic effects of the COVID-19 pandemic are concerned, is the tourism sector. As such, Airbnb has just announced new cleaning protocols to ensure sanitised homes—this appears to be part of an effort to reassure potential customers over coronavirus-related concerns.  The “Enhanced Cleaning Initiative” has been developed with the help of former U.S. Surgeon general Dr Vivek Murthy, along with “leading experts in hospitality and medical hygiene”. Airbnb also says that the protocol is “informed by U.S. Centers of Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) standards”.  However, the new protocol isn’t mandatory for all hosts, although guests will be able to see if a property/listing is part of the new program.     As part of the new protocol, hosts will be given guidelines on preventing the spread of COVID-19, including information on approved disinfectants and protective gear for hosts or cleaners. Once the “enhanced cleaning” protocol is complete—as well as a mandatory 24-hour wait period—eligible listings will be available to rent immediately.  According to Dr Vivek Murthy:  “As a society, we need to observe the physical distancing recommendations made by public health officials while finding ways to preserve and strengthen human connection. I’m looking forward to helping the Airbnb community as it develops a health and science based approach for safe travel lodging and experiences. These approaches will continue to evolve as our knowledge and understanding of COVID-19 grows.”     Meanwhile, hosts that do not sign up for the new cleaning protocol can choose to use a new feature: Booking Buffer. In a nutshell, this requires hosts to have a 72-hour vacancy period between stays, including the CDC-recommended 24 hours. Airbnb also reminds hosts to abide by social distancing and other preventive guidelines by health authorities.  Like the rest of the tourism world, Airbnb has been hit hard by the global pandemic, and resulting closures and lockdowns across the globe. A planned share offering by the company has reportedly been postponed, and up to US$250 million has been lost in refunds and reimbursements.  The company appears to be fairly confident that demand for travel will go back up once the current situation improves, however. Referring to a company survey, Airbnb claims that 92% of registered hosts on the platform say that they will host again, or even more often, once the pandemic subsides.  “We have seen indications that hosts are committed to hosting and we think people will be eager to travel in the future. In a recent company survey, 92 percent of hosts around the world responded that they plan to host as often as before, or more often, once the pandemic is over.”  [ IMAGE SOURCE ]	News
How to Develop a COVID-19 Vaccine for All   28 Apr 2020, 09:49   In the early weeks of 2020, it started to dawn on people that COVID-19 could be the long-dreaded but expected “Disease X” – a global pandemic caused by an unknown virus.  Three months later, the majority of the world’s population is in lockdown, and it is clear that we are only as healthy as our neighbours – locally, nationally, and internationally.  Strong health systems, adequate testing capacity, and an effective, universally available vaccine will be key to protecting societies from COVID-19. But ensuring that no one is left behind requires not just an unprecedented collective investment, but also a very different approach.  Researchers at universities and companies around the world are racing to develop a vaccine. And current progress is encouraging: 73 vaccine candidates are actively being explored or are in preclinical development, while five already have entered clinical trials.  These massive efforts are possible only because of substantial public investment, including by the US National Institutes of Health and the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations (CEPI).  The latter, a publicly funded non-profit organization, was established after the 2014-16 West African Ebola epidemic to drive research and development of vaccines that could be deployed during disease outbreaks.  CEPI has so far received an extra $765 million of a targeted $2 billion in funding for COVID-19 vaccine development from multiple governments.  The Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority, part of the US Department of Health and Human Services, has invested substantially in vaccine-development projects with Johnson & Johnson ($450 million) and Moderna ($483 million). And the European Union intends to mobilize further public funding to tackle the pandemic at an online pledging conference on May 4.  But investment alone is not enough. To succeed, the entire vaccine-innovation process, from R&D to access, must be governed by clear and transparent rules of engagement based on public-interest goals and metrics. That, in turn, will require a clear alignment between global and national public interests.  The first, critical step is to adopt a mission-oriented approach that focuses both public and private investments on achieving a clearly defined common goal: developing an effective COVID-19 vaccine(s) that can be produced at global scale rapidly and made universally available for free.  Realizing this aim will require firm rules regarding intellectual property (IP), pricing, and manufacturing, designed and enforced in ways that value international collaboration and solidarity, rather than competition between countries.  Second, to maximize the impact on public health, the innovation ecosystem must be steered to use collective intelligence to accelerate advances.  Science and medical innovation thrive and progress when researchers exchange and share knowledge openly, enabling them to build upon one another’s successes and failures in real-time.  But today’s proprietary science does not follow that model. Instead, it promotes secretive competition, prioritizes regulatory approval in wealthy countries over wide availability and global public-health impact, and erects barriers to technological diffusion.  And, although voluntary IP pools like the one that Costa Rica has proposed to the World Health Organization can be helpful, they risk being ineffective as long as private, for-profit companies are allowed to retain control over critical technologies and data – even when these were generated with public investments.  Moreover, collective steering is vital in order to select and pursue the most promising potential vaccines. Otherwise, marketing authorization may go to the best-resourced candidate rather than the most suitable one.  Third, countries must take the lead in building and buttressing manufacturing capabilities, particularly in the developing world.  While an effective COVID-19 vaccine probably will not be available for another 12-18 months, a concerted effort is needed now to put in place the public and private capacity and infrastructure needed to produce rapidly the billions of doses that will be required.  Because we don’t know yet which vaccine will prove most effective, we may need to invest in a range of assets and technologies.  This poses a technological and financial risk that can be overcome only with the help of entrepreneurial states backed by collective, public-interest-driven financing, such as from national and regional development banks, the World Bank, and philanthropic foundations.  Finally, conditions for ensuring global, equitable, and affordable access must be built into any vaccine-development program from the start. This would allow public investments to be structured less like a handout or simple market-fixer, and more like a proactive market-shaper, driven by public objectives.  Pricing of COVID-19 vaccines should reflect both the substantial public contribution to their development and the urgency and magnitude of the global health crisis.  We must go beyond statements of principle and generic pledges, and introduce concrete conditions that enable vaccines to be free at the point of use. Policymakers should also consider using compulsory licensing to allow countries to make the best use of available tools and technologies.  Crucially, we need collective procurement mechanisms that ensure fair allocation and equitable global access to the new vaccines as they become available.  The overriding goal must be to prevent advanced economies from monopolizing the global supply or crowding out demand from poorer countries.  The COVID-19 crisis rules out a business-as-usual approach. As countries mobilize collectively against the pandemic through calls for a global alliance, pledging conferences, G20 meetings, and the upcoming annual World Health Assembly, we cannot afford to miss this chance.  These collective efforts must include clear and enforceable rules of engagement that commit all partners to an end-to-end approach to health innovation based on the public interest: an effective COVID-19 vaccine that can be rapidly made available to all for free.  Developing an effective and universally available COVID-19 vaccine is one of the most critical missions of our lifetime.  Above all, it is a litmus test of whether global public-private cooperation, touted by policymakers as the key to success, will maximize the supply of public goods or the share of private profits.

Please Enjoy Cyberpunk 2077 In 8K  28 Apr 2020, 09:00 by Alex Walker     Cyberpunk 2077 is a stunning looking game already, and it's not even out. But does that mean AI can't make it look even better? Of course not.  Having already remastered the original reveal and done a bang-up job on CD Projekt Red's best intro cinematic to date - that's The Witcher 2 , in case you're wondering - the Upscale channel on YouTube has given the E3 trailer from a couple of years ago the full AI treatment.  You wouldn't ordinarily think that there's much work to be done with such a recent game, but you'd be surprised. The amount of extra detail that can be pulled out of Night City is remarkable, especially when you start looking at textures more closely. Look at the eyes below in the first picture, or even just the sharpness and detail on the Quadra V-Tech in the fourth shot (as well as the city in the background).              The full video in motion is below. It's still a great watch, 8K or otherwise, but it's definitely nicer if your PC or phone can handle it.     A longer deep-dive of gameplay from E3 last year has been upscaled to 8K as well, although because of the nature of live gameplay, I don't think the neural network handles this quite as well. The work in progress font in particular looks really jarring throughout, and the extra softness you get on the UI text doesn't look good when sharpened up.  Upscaling techniques like this tend to work really well on facial models, low-poly textures, fibrous of metal details. Think muscle veins, arteries, specks of paint on a piece of armour or that bit of cloth under a shirt. That said, we're talking footage that is already fairly high quality here. Cyberpunk 2077 isn't out, but just think of the effect of upscaling live gameplay from, say, the original Mass Effect . Or older games from the 2000-2005 era. There's a lot of potential, basically.

Rumour – Injustice 3 coming in 2022, will feature Constantine, Doctor Manhattan and Neo from The Matrix  28 Apr 2020, 09:00 by Darryn Bonthuys     If you’d told me back in 2010 that the home of a certain wascally wabbit was going to also be a hub for some of my favourite games of this generation, I’d have laughed in your face and probably knocked you into a coma with my severe halitosis. And yet here we are, with the previous decade having delivered several fantastic Batman games, Mortal Kombats galore and a proper home for Hitman after it was dumped at the prom by Square Enix.  Warner Bros. Interactive has a damn good library right now, with the scales so heavily balanced on the good side of the equation that their rare misfires have been catapulted into the abyss. This year was supposed to be the year of Warner Bros. Interactive if you can believe the rumours, until.. the happening occurred. With E3 cancelled and the prime space for their first-ever press conference now essentially worthless, Warner Bros. Interactive was currently sitting on some hot announcements and no real platform to show them off on.  What games are in store from that brand though? According to one leaker (And I do suggest taking two massive fistfuls of salt with this), Warner Bros. Interactive currently has plans to reveal Hitman 3, the next Batman title from Warner Bros. Montreal and a game of the year edition of Mortal kombat 11. Plausible reveals considering the nature of the industry.  It’s the mention of Injustice 3 that currently has my ears buzzing, especially with the 4Chan leaker claiming that their source at Warner Bros. Interactive has given them the scoop on who’ll be featured inside of the brawler that is meant to be the finale of the grand saga centered on what would happen if Superman became a totalitarian dick :     Injustice 3. Finale of the trilogy. Two story modes. First NetherRealm next-gen release. More customising options with five slots. Some characters will include John Constantine, Huntress, Penguin, Etrigan, Killer Croc, Zatanna, Doctor Manhattan and Neo / Keanu Reeves. Tournament mode also coming similar to Mortal Kombat 11’s Kombat League called Infinite Crisis. Villain of the game is Nekron. Release window eyed for 2022.  I know it’s a rumour, dammit I now. But like I say every time I buy a lottery ticket on a Tuesday, I can dream dammit . I can’t not see an Injustice 3 being released eventually, what with NetherRealm having made Injustice a fighting game staple between Mortal Kombat releases. Injustice 2 was a game-changer when it was released, thanks to some incredible storytelling, amazing combat and it being the only game in existence that actually got the idea of loot boxes right.  It’s that roster that has me frothing at the mouth though, as that’s a hell of a cast to anchor a fighting game with. I mean, just imagine breathing hellfire into the Joker’s face as Etrigan and then finishing him off with some demonic rhyming. OH HELL YES I WANT THAT. Plus a guest fighter in the form of Neo from The Matrix? It’s about damn time that someone thought of this.  For now though, it’s wishful thinking and a rumour on the wind.	NotNews
African regulators urged to allow cloud tech in financial services  28 Apr 2020, 09:52 by Samuel Mungadze  African regulators have to support and approve the use of cloud technology within the financial sector, says a new industry report.  The study, Cloud Banking in Africa: The Regulatory Opportunity , by Genesis Analytics and Orange Business Services, says cloud computing has the potential to unlock value in financial services through reducing costs.  It urges regulators to follow global trends in the use of cloud technology within the financial sector, saying cloud computing creates an opportunity for service providers to rethink their technology spend and significantly reduce costs.  “The report urges African regulators to develop clear policy positions and regulations on data privacy, risk and security; data sovereignty; cyber crime; protection of intellectual property; vendor risk; and migration complexity as well as operational risk, to enable financial institutions to reap the benefit of cloud banking,” says Genesis Analytics.  The report calls upon African regulators to follow their peers in the European Union, which it says has been at the forefront of defining an enabling regulatory environment for cloud banking services, which involved both the regulation of the use of data, and privacy and protection of data.  It reads: “Under the regulations, financial institutions have to ensure consumer personal data is gathered legally and under strict conditions and that consumer data is fully protected. Other developing markets like Turkey and Argentina have adopted similar legal and regulatory environments, which has enabled the use of cloud banking in their financial sectors.”   See also     The researchers argue further that more than 700 million Africans lack access to a bank or mobile money account, and cloud solutions can ease the situation as they help reduce the costs of serving clients.  The report says cloud computing allows banks to pay less for ICT infrastructure and services, and achieve higher utilisation on ICT spend.  “Particularly for small banks in small markets where specialised ICT skills are in short supply, cloud computing can ease a critical operational constraint.  “The most compelling reason to move to the cloud is undoubtedly cost savings, but there are other business reasons too. The flexibility of cloud-based operational models allows financial institutions to experience shorter development cycles for new products, which supports a faster and more efficient response to the needs of customers.  “Cloud computing provides the computer power necessary to deliver analytical insights in real-time, which enables financial institutions to move towards a customer-centric model where the financial needs of customers are fully understood. Financial institutions can also gain a higher level of data security, resilience, fault tolerance and disaster recovery from cloud computing.”  According to the report, a few international and African banks have already realised the value of cloud banking.  “WeBank is China’s first digital bank that is based in a private cloud and uses innovative technologies, such as artificial intelligence and blockchain, to effect an extraordinarily high volume of transactions at a very low cost.  “WeBank has been able to run at 95% lower cost than that of traditional banks’ IT operations and has passed this cost saving onto their customers in the form of low account fees. TymeBank is a new digital entrant to the South African banking sector and has made a 56% cost saving compared to other start-ups by using cloud services from Amazon Web Services (AWS).”  The report comes at a time the continent is witnessing a cloud “land grab”, with multinational companies opening their data centre facilities locally.  Last week, AWS announced the opening of the AWS Africa (Cape Town) Region.  US-based software giant Microsoft opened two data centre regions in SA last year, becoming the first global provider to deliver cloud services from data centres on the African continent.  In March last year, Chinese telecommunications giant Huawei started offering its cloud services in SA. The company is leasing a data centre in Johannesburg from a partner, from where it is deploying localised public cloud services based on local industry policies, customer requirements and partner conditions.  US-based enterprise software company Oracle also joined in, announcing in September last year plans to launch data centres in SA.	News
Pace Of Q2 2020 Dividend Cuts Accelerates  28 Apr 2020, 09:26 by Ironman at Political Calculations  Summary   During the past week and a half, an additional 44 distressed firms either reduced dividends or suspended payments to our ongoing tally for April 2020.  To put that number in perspective, when recessionary conditions are present in the U.S. economy, we'll see firms announce dividend cuts at a rate of 25 or more during the course of a single month.  We now anticipate triple that figure by the time April 2020 is over.   The pace of dividend cuts in the U.S. surged during the past week and a half, where we've added an additional 44 distressed firms either reducing their dividends or suspending payments to our ongoing tally for April 2020.  To put that number in perspective, when recessionary conditions are present in the U.S. economy, we'll see firms announce dividend cuts at a rate of 25 or more during the course of a single month. We now anticipate triple that figure by the time April 2020 is over.  The following chart compares the current pace of dividend cuts during 2020-Q2 to the same quarter in the years 2017, 2018, and 2019, which is the stock market equivalent to those excess  mortality charts illustrating the full impact of the COVID-19 coronavirus pandemic.     We confirm the number of dividend cuts and suspensions announced in the quarter to date for our 2020-Q2 sampling is elevated well above the comparatively healthy quarters of 2017-Q2 and 2018-Q2, and is also considerably higher than the year ago quarter of 2019-Q2, when the oil and gas sector of the U.S. economy experienced a relatively short period of distress.  Here is the list of U.S. firms announcing dividend cuts or omitting dividend cuts in the seven trading days since our previous report :   Apache (NYSE: APA)  Goodyear Tire & Rubber (NYSE: GT)  Cedar Shopping Centers (REIT-Retail) (NYSE: CDR)  Green Plains Partners (NASDAQ: GPP)  Noble Energy (NYSE: NBL)  Chesapeake Energy (NYSE: CHK)  Permianville Royalty Trust (NYSE: PVL)  VOC Energy Trust (NYSE: VOC)  Service Properties (REIT-Hotel) (NASDAQ: SVC)  Kohl's (NYSE: KSS)  Schlumberger (NYSE: SLB)  Targa Resources (NYSE: TRGP)  San Juan Basin Royalty Trust (NYSE: SJT)  Cross Timbers Royalty Trust (NYSE: CRT)  Permian Basin Royalty Trust (NYSE: PBT)  Western Midstream Partners (NYSE: WES)  RBB Bancorp (NASDAQ: RBB)  EnLink Midstream (NYSE: ENLC)  Mesa Royalty Trust (NYSE: MTR)  Landmark Infrastructure (Real Estate) (NASDAQ: LMRK)  HCA Healthcare (NYSE: HCA)  Anworth Mortgage Asset (REIT-Mortgage) (NYSE: ANH)  DCP Midstream (NYSE: DCP)  STMicroelectronics (NYSE: STM)  BBX Capital (NYSE: BBX)  Retail Opportunity Investments (REIT-Retail) (NASDAQ: ROIC)  Moelis (NYSE: MC)  Manning & Napier (NYSE: MN)  Black Stone Minerals (NYSE: BSM)  Bluegreen Vacations (NYSE: BXG)  Patterson-UTI Energy (NYSE: PTEN)  Alliance Data Systems (NYSE: ADS)  Invesco (NYSE: IVZ)  1st Source (NASDAQ: SRCE)  Lifetime Brands (NASDAQ: LCUT)  Northern Technologies (NASDAQ: NTIC)  Blackstone Group (NYSE: BX)  San Juan Basin Royalty Trust (NYSE: SJT)  Holly Energy Partners (NYSE: HEP)  USD Partners (NYSE: USDP)  Dynamic Materials (NASDAQ: BOOM)  Community West Bancshares (NASDAQ: CWBC)  CONSOL Coal Resources (NYSE: CCR)  CenterPoint Energy (NYSE: CNP)   The oil and gas sector makes up 20 of the 44 firms above, an outcome of the fall in demand and oil prices that has taken place since with the global coronavirus pandemic. The finance sector, including real estate investment trusts, accounts for another 10 firms, with the remainder split among 11 other industrial sectors, confirming the broad impact of the coronavirus recession.  The distribution of these dividend cuts among industries is a consequence of both the degree of distress they are facing and also of the calendar, with many companies following their regular schedule for declaring dividends, with the past seven trading days being heavily loaded with firms in the oil and gas sector.

"World cannot afford a lost generation of youth due to COVID-19: Antonio Guterres  28 Apr 2020, 09:01 by PTI  UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres has warned that the risk of radicalisation can increase during the COVID-19 pandemic as extremist groups seek to exploit the anger and despair of the young, asserting the world cannot afford a lost generation due to the global crisis.  In a video conference Monday, Guterres told the Security Council that even before the current crisis, young people were facing enormous challenges.  Listing “startling” numbers, he said one of every five young people was already not in education, training or employment and one of every four is affected by violence or conflict. Every year, 12 million girls become mothers while they themselves are still children.    For latest updates and live news on coronavirus, click here    “These frustrations and, frankly, failures to address them by those in power today, fuel declining confidence in political establishments and institutions. And when such a cycle takes hold, it is all too easy for extremist groups to exploit the anger and despair, and the risk of radicalization climbs,” he said.  The UN chief noted that “we can already see such groups taking advantage of the COVID-19 lockdowns, intensifying their efforts on social media to spread hatred and to recruit young people who may be spending more time at home and on line.”  He made the remarks during a meeting to review the five years since its adoption of a landmark resolution on youth, peace and security.  Issuing a call to action on youth, peace and security, Guterres said the “world cannot afford a lost generation of youth, their lives set back by COVID-19 and their voices stifled by a lack of participation. Let us do far more to tap their talents as we tackle the pandemic and chart a recovery that leads to a more peaceful, sustainable and equitable future for all.”  With over 1.54 billion children and youth out-of-school and young people acutely feeling the impact of the COVID19 crisis, Guterres said countries must do more to harness the talents of young people to address the crisis and its aftermath.  In presenting his first report on Security Council resolution, the UN chief said youth were already confronting numerous challenges even before the pandemic, including in accessing education, or through being affected by violence and conflict. Those pressing for peace or upholding human rights have been threatened.  Despite these obstacles, young people across the world have joined the common fight against the coronavirus disease, supporting both frontline workers and people in need. And they continue to push for change.  UN Youth Envoy Jayathma Wickramanayake spoke of the need for more meaningful partnerships between young people and the civil society organizations and government institutions that work on the youth, peace and security (YPS) agenda.  “To date, there are no national action plans on YPS but I’m pleased to note that in some countries, these are in the process of development,” she said.  “For a national roadmap to be successful, a participatory, transparent and youth–led process with adequate resources are needed.”  Issuing his four-point call to action for the Council, Guterres urged members to do more to address the various challenges facing young people. He also called for investment in youth participation, but also in their organizations and initiatives.  “We must strengthen human rights protections and protect the civic space on which youth participation depends,” he said. “And fourth, we must emerge from the COVID-19 crisis with a determination to recover better – massively increasing our investment in young people’s capacities as we deliver the Sustainable Development Goals.""

"You are a snake, Ramnaresh Sarwan: Chris Gayle lashes out at former West Indian teammate  Jamaica Tallawahs chose not to retain Gayle after the West Indian re-joined the franchise last season. Chris Gayle will represent St Lucia Zouks in the 2020 CPL season   28 Apr 2020, 08:23   HIGHLIGHTS   Chris Gayle has lashed out at Ramnaresh Sarwan in a YouTube message  Gayle blamed Sarwan for his fallout with CPL franchise Jamaica Tallawahs  Gayle called his former West Indian teammate worse than coronavirus   Chirs Gayle has lashed out at former West Indian teammate Ramnaresh Sarwan and has called him ' snake' and 'worse than coronavirus' for his alleged role in the former's fallout with the Caribbean Premier League (CPL) franchise Jamaica Tallawahs.  “Sarwan, you are worse than the coronavirus right now,” Gayle said in the video released in three parts on his official YouTube channel where he ripped apart the former West Indian skipper.  Jamaica Tallawahs chose not to retain Gayle after the West Indian re-joined the franchise last season. Chris Gayle will represent St Lucia Zouks in the 2020 CPL season where he will be playing under the leadership of Darren Sammy and head coach Andy Flower.  Gayle played for the Tallawahs in the first four CPL seasons before representing St Kitts and Nevis Patriots. in the next two seasons.  “What transpired with the Tallahwahs, you had a big part to play. Sarwan, you were the one who gave a big speech at my birthday party about how far we have come. Sarwan, you are a snake. You know, you are not the most loved person in the Caribbean. You are so vindictive, you are still immature, you are back-stabbing. When are you planning to change?"" Gayle said in the YouTube video.  ""That goes to show your own people undermine you. Doesn't matter how far you and they are coming from, they still undermine you,"" said Gayle.  ""Out of that era - 1996 - I'm the only one active, playing. Everyone else retired. I'm the last man standing within that era...and I'm still going strong. So it kind of hurt them to see Chris Gayle still playing and still being successful. I'm talking about past and present players. But I'm dealing with you Sarwan. I'll deal (with the others) whenever that time comes.""     ""The amount of lies he used to tell on the players...him and the team management were not getting on.""  The CPL is scheduled between August 19 and September 26, however, there could be a change in the dates due to the ongoing Covid-19 crisis. The tournament will be played behind closed doors or without overseas players, or delayed until December, as organizers continue to discuss the roadmap for the league."	NotNews

MAKORI: Our sportspeople need psychosocial support now more than  28 Apr 2020, 01:01 by ELIAS MAKORI  In Summary   Lack of emotional intelligence leads to anxiety that in turns propels people into substance abuse, which was the case with the Jamhuri, Kilimani and Milimani groups busted over the last seven days  Indeed, investment in emotional intelligence is one area over-looked by coaches and federations which needs to come into play now more than ever  Equally, sports associations must adjust and invest in professional support for sportspeople’s mental health   On Sunday, a concerned resident blew the lid off an ill-advised house party organised by a group of youngsters in Nairobi’s Jamhuri Estate.  The 18 young Kenyans, some barely in their teens, were busted by police allegedly stark naked, shooting nudes and imbibing copious amounts of liquor.  This incident came just days after another group of about 20 was uncovered, hidden in a Kilimani restaurant and gulping alcohol by the bottle, in flagrant contravention of public health laws against such assembly owing to fears over the indiscriminate spread of coronavirus.  Sunday’s incident came barely a week after a carbon-copy gathering in which a group of 21 youth, disguised as a “talent bank” was unmasked in Nakuru’s Milimani Estate, allegedly high on a cocktail of nocturnal, pornographic orgy.  These are just three incidents.  I’m sure occurrence books across our police lines have further similar entries, while many others may have escaped the long arm of the law, countrywide.  While the randy Jamhuri Estate group faced charges on Monday, Rift Valley authorities confirmed the 21 truants arrested in Nakuru were all quarantined for a 14-day period as medics look out for any Covid-19 symptoms.  Herein lies the problem.  The Rift Valley security officials claim they are “only concerned with their (youth’s) health status,” and that the issue of counselling “belongs to different people.”   HUGE CRISIS   Although these security chiefs, thankfully, say the incident is “a parenting guidance problem and not a security concern,” it highlights a huge crisis that’s been triggered by Covid-19, and which will most certainly explode post-virus, if urgent pre-emptive measures aren’t employed.  With the dusk-to-dawn curfew extended for another three weeks, schools remaining closed, pubs still a no-go zone, social distancing emphasized, open group sports training sessions outlawed and the stay-at-home mantra sustained, our young population is desperately searching for apertures to ventilate.  Traditionally, our sports coaches and officials of sports federations focus squarely on the one-dimensional approach of physical performance, with little or no attention at all directed at psychological aspects of the athlete, yet it’s essential to strike the right balance between mind and body.  The current coronavirus lockdown is the biggest test of character yet for us all - and especially for amateur and elite athletes - since the guns fell silent, ending the Second World War on September 2, 1945.  Like was the case post-war, after the coronavirus is dead and buried, some sportspeople will emerge battered and bruised, while others will surface unscathed, physically and mentally.  Just as Olympic champion, world record holder and “sub-two man” Eliud Kipchoge has always emphasized, success in sport depends on one’s physical and mental shape, a fact which Kenyan psychologist Lambert Oigara endorses.   POSITIVE MINDSET   Drawing from the book The Mindset – The New Psychology of Success (by Carole Dweck, an American psychologist, author and professor at Stanford University) that seeks to distinguish between fixed mindset and growth mindset, Oigara stresses the need for our sportspeople to develop a positive state of mind that will hold them in good stead, post-virus.  “It really calls for resilience and a resilient mind,” Oigara, who practices in Nairobi, kindly obliged after I ambushed him with an unscheduled telephone call on Monday.  “Only resilient people will successfully go through this pandemic,” he added.  “Coaches and sports leaders must support people within their groups with positive talk, and offer the hope for a better tomorrow.”  Indeed, investment in emotional intelligence is one area over-looked by coaches and federations which needs to come into play now more than ever.  “Sports people need to regroup and engage professionals to talk to them consistently so as to help them build emotional intelligence, so that their IQ (human intelligence) can be sustainable,” Oigara prescribes.  Lack of emotional intelligence leads to anxiety that in turn propels people into substance abuse, which was the case with the Jamhuri, Kilimani and Milimani groups busted over the last seven days.  Further prescription from Oigara is that close community connection makes for good therapy, and that sportspeople must be allowed to express their thoughts and feelings over and over again so as to avoid being traumatized by the Covid-19 ghost and melt away into depression.  Indeed, our sportspeople must be helped to chart their destiny out by being in control of their thoughts and behaviour, in order to build resilience.   MENTAL HEALTH   Internally, at Nation Media Group, our good management has organised staff counselling services with the company’s health insurance brokers in appreciation of the fact that the Covid-19 pandemic will certainly take its toll on staff, especially frontline journalists on the virus beat.  Equally, sports associations must adjust and invest in professional support for sportspeople’s mental health.  Technical benches should - in addition to coaches, trainers, doctors and their assistants –enlist psychologists, nutritionists and even chaplains.  Sportspeople must develop the growth mindset.  “The growth mindset helps people keep going despite the inevitable difficulties they will face on their journey,” Dweck explains in her book originally published in 2006.  “Those with the growth mindset will more likely love what they do as obstacles appear as opportunities to learn something new.  “By believing their talents can be developed, it allows them to fulfill their true potential.”  Pandemics come and go, and, indeed, Covid-19 will soon be history.  We must be prepared to reinvent ourselves and get back to the grind stronger physically, mentally and spiritually.  Speaking of spiritually, let me conclude by wishing our Muslim brothers and sisters in sport, and generally, Ramadhan Mubarak. Saum Maqbul.  We shall emerge from this pandemic stronger, Inshallah.

Herdsmen abduct another 4 persons in Delta  28 Apr 2020, 06:05 by Nwafor  Kindly Share This Story:    Herdsmen   •Collect N200,000 ransom to release Emeka after 24hrs •Extort N6,500 from a farmer •There was no kidnap, they were repelled — Delta PPRO  By Emma Amaize, Regional Editor, South-South & Festus Ahon  Suspected herdsmen have continued their onslaught against unsuspecting residents of Delta State, following the kidnap of three peasant farmers and a resident at Admiralty Neighbourhood Estate, Ibusa, Oshimili North Local Government Area of the state, weekend.  The suspected herdsmen, numbering five, had stormed a compound in the Ibusa neighbourhood to abduct a landlord, who sighted them earlier and escaped with his wife, using a ladder to scale through the fence.  Emeka, a tenant in the compound, watching television at about 8.30 pm when the kidnappers struck was not so lucky, as the entrance to his apartment was unfastened.  A resident, who said the people were worried over the frequent attacks and abductions, told Vanguard: “The rampaging herdsmen caught Emeka, reportedly watching wrestling in his living room and left the door to his flat open, napping.”  He hinted: ” The landlord, who had escaped with his wife, raised the alarm that herdsmen have held his tenant hostage, which prompted the neighbours to immediately go to the Ibusa Police Station to alert the Police.”  “The Police initially declined to follow them on the excuse that they had no fuel in their patrol van until one of the neighbours volunteered to take them to the scene in his car. Two policemen followed them armed with guns.”  “On getting to the scene, the herdsmen were still with Emeka in his apartment, but rather than confront them, the police officers said they were going back to get reinforcement,” he added.  The inhabitants decried that the hoodlums had left with Emeka into the bush before the policemen returned.  He, however, said Emeka was released after payment of N200,000 Sunday night at Azagba-Ogwashi by the herdsmen, who initially demanded N20 million for his release, threatening to kill him (Emeka) if the N20 million was not paid.  Besides the N200,000 paid as ransom, those who took the money to free him were also asked to bring seven plates of food and recharge card of N5,000.  READ ALSO: Coronavirus and our fault lines  Other residents, who spoke to Vanguard, said: “A delegation from the Neighbourhood was scheduled to meet the Commissioner of Police, Mr Hafiz Inuwa, yesterday, at Asaba to handover a letter, detailing our plight and asking for protection.”  “The truth is that we are under siege by herdsmen and we want the police to act. They kidnap people almost every other day in Ibusa,” he added.  On the kidnap of three peasant farmers, a reliable source said: “The farmers were on their farms working between Ibusa and Azagba Ogwashi when they were picked by the ravaging armed herdsmen earlier in the day before Emeka was kidnapped.”  According to the source, “Emeka and the three peasant farmers were kept in one camp at Mgbirigba Road, where they call 45 Estate in the bush. The three farmers had also regained their freedom after payment of ransom.”  “Imagine, they collected N6,500 from one of them, I do not have the facts on how much the others paid,” he added.  The Police Public Relations Officer, PPRO, in the state, DSP Onome Onovwakpoyeya, said nobody was kidnapped at Ibusa on Saturday, when contacted by Vanguard, adding that the hoodlums who went to the Admiralty Neighbourhood Estate on that day were chased away by soldiers before the Police got there.  Onovwakpoyeya held that the Police were keeping vigil in the area, saying that some hoodlums, who went to attack the area, Thursday, last week, were also repelled by the Police.

Lockdown side effect: Loss of jobs for many as companies go for layoff option  Some are sole breadwinners of their families; bleak prospect for bachelors.  28 Apr 2020, 06:47 by Sahaya Novinston Lobo  CHENNAI: While everyone is fighting their own battles during the lockdown, many people across the State have been laid off by their employers. Most of these companies are small scale service providers for foreign countries.  S Amal Pullikan, a native of Kerala was working in a private company in Nungambakkam. His company deals with clients of an American insurance company. On March 21, Amal went home to Palakkad after the company announced that employees can work from home. Two weeks into lockdown, he no longer had the job.  “On April 13, we received an email stating that the company had decided to lay off 27 people with a one-week notice. The next day they sent a personal emails saying that the company is in financial depression and we were fired. They also said that the pending salary will be credited only after lockdown is over and normalcy returns,” said Amal.  The 29-year-old man worked in the company for two years and his marriage had been fixed at the end of May, which has been postponed to September.  Now that he is without a job, the girl’s family is reconsidering the marriage proposal.  Similarly, Vinay Kumar Manyala (name changed), a native of Telangana was working at an IT company in Royapettah.  “I stayed in Chennai after the lockdown was announced and was working from home. On April 2, I received an email stating that I and 15 others are expected to work only till May 2,” he said.  His mother, who is alone in his native town, does not know that he has lost his job.  “I can’t tell my mother now as I’m the only breadwinner of the family. I’ll go home after the lockdown and let her know. I’ve contacted many of my friends to apply for new jobs. But some of them have also lost jobs and the companies are not willing to recruit anytime soon,” concluded Vinay.	NotNews

"Lawmakers upset over Jokowi’s social media gaffe on job creation omnibus bill  28 Apr 2020, 06:01 by Ghina Ghaliya  Lawmakers have expressed their disagreement over President Joko “Jokowi” Widodo’s recent social media posts that claim the government and the House of Representatives agreed on delaying deliberations on a disputed omnibus bill on job creation.  The posts, published on Jokowi's Facebook, Twitter and Instagram accounts on Monday morning, were edited a few minutes later. The revised posts now say that the government and the House agreed on delaying deliberations over labor provisions within the bill .  Rieke Diah Pitaloka of the ruling Indonesian Democratic Party of Struggle (PDI-P) said on Monday that should the government wish to cancel the entire deliberation, it must revoke the draft bill from the House.  Rieke added that the government should avoid acting on anything that could trigger public outrage projected toward the House.  ""Lawmakers will be blamed for continuing the deliberations, even though we have followed the proper procedures. Don't let the public think that only the House wants to deliberate the bill,” she during a virtual hearing of the bill on Monday with several experts and the House legislative body.  Achmad Baidowi of the United Development Party (PPP) called on the presidential communication team to explain the errors to the public and asserted that the House was not forcing the deliberation.   Read also    ""This makes us uncomfortable. There is a tweet from President Jokowi saying that the bill was being postponed. It was clear a few days ago that the government and the House were only canceling deliberations on labor provisions,"" he said.  Firman Subagyo of the Golkar Party said as long as the President did not revoke the presidential letter (Surpres) from the House, the deliberations should continue, noting that lawmakers should get over the tweet.  ""We don't need to talk about the tweet. It will only create noise. We need to hold on to the fact that the [presidential letter] has not been revoked. The discussion should continue,"" he said.  At Monday’s hearing, experts and lawmakers suggested a change to the bill’s title as the labor provisions were being canceled.  Rieke suggested the bill could be changed to the omnibus bill on the facilitation of investment licensing or the economic reform bill, which the experts also suggested.  ""This will also create certainty for the public; that this bill does not regulate labor,"" he said."	News

Liver and Lung Productions co-founder and Sepet: The Musical choreographer Hannah Shields said the company hopes they can bring audiences and performers closer together during the movement control order by sharing digital theatre content online.  “The show sold out almost immediately, so we’re happy that we get to share it with you now,” Shields said in a press release.  Sepet: The Musical is based on the 2005 film that follows the blossoming romance between Jason, a Chinese DVD seller with a knack for poetry, and Orked, a Malay schoolgirl who loves Takeshi Kaneshiro and John Woo films.  As outside forces threaten their relationship, Jason and Orked are forced to confront the racial tensions and class divides plaguing Malaysian society in order to keep their love alive.  The musical was held in partnership with GM Bukit Bintang Mall and ran for three sold-out weekends last September.    After 15 years, the story of Orked and Jason continues to strike an emotional chord with a contemporary audience. — Picture courtesy of Liver and Lung Productions   Liver and Lung Productions co-founder and Sepet: The Musical director Shafeeq Shajahan said it’s telling how the themes in Yasmin’s film continue to resonate with audiences 15 years on.  He hopes that the musical can pay homage to Yasmin’s work and revive it for a new generation of audiences to appreciate.  “We saw people from all walks of life come and watch the show and they all took something away from it.  “Tapping into the magic that Yasmin Ahmad created was incredibly humbling. People were in tears every night. We had something incredible in our hands.  “The vision for Sepet: The Musical was to stay authentic to its source material and reignite the film’s narrative for a new generation of Malaysians,” said Shafeeq in a press release.  Starring Joshua Gui and Badrika Bahadur, Sepet: The Musical will be released at 9pm on May 1 on Liver and Lung Productions’ YouTube channel.  The recording will be available online until May 9 and there will be a live talkback session on May 2, 9pm with the creative team behind the musical.      Related Articles	NotNews
"Inside royals' 'real world' - Entertainment News  28 Apr 2020, 06:13 by WENN     Photo: All rights reserved.    Prince Harry and Meghan, Duchess of Sussex are reportedly co-operating with biographers on a new book promising to unveil their ""real world."" The biography, provisionally titled Thoroughly Modern Royals: The Real World Of Harry And Meghan, was due to be published by New York's Dey Street Books in June, but has been delayed amid the COVID-19 pandemic. According to British newspaper The Independent, the tome will now be released in August, after writers were given access to the Duchess's engagements on a small number of occasions. Staff in the royal households are believed to have been aware of its existence for months and, while there is concern about how much the couple's ""friends'' will reveal about the personal lives of the royal family, some have expressed exasperation at the ongoing drama surrounding the Sussexes and their exit from Britain. It comes after the couple stepped down as senior royals last month, and are currently isolating against the coronavirus at their new home in Los Angeles, with Harry recently confessing to spending the lockdown ""rolling around in hysterics"" as he spends time with 11-month-old son, Archie."

Former NASCAR champion Matt Kenseth will once again come out of retirement to compete for Chip Ganassi Racing as the replacement for fired driver Kyle Larson. [AP Photo/John Raoux, File]    NASCAR   Matt Kenseth returns to NASCAR to replace Kyle Larson at Ganassi   Matt Kenseth decided he was ready to get behind the wheel full-time again and Ganassi made the official announcement Monday. Now the two-time Daytona 500 winner has to wait until the season resumes until he can compete again in stock car racing's top circuit.  Being quarantined due to the coronavirus at his home in the Charlotte, North Carolina, area gave the 2003 Cup champion from Cambridge, Wisconsin, plenty of time to ponder replacing Kyle Larson in the No. 42 Chevrolet for Chip Ganassi Racing.  Larson was fired on April 14 for using a racial slur while participating in a virtual race. That opening started serious discussions between Kenseth and his wife, who have four daughters under 11.  Kenseth has won 39 times in the Cup Series. During his 22-season NASCAR career, he also won 29 races in what is now the Xfinity Series. He last ran full-time in 2017, winning his penultimate Cup race with Joe Gibbs Racing. Kenseth returned part-time in 2018 with Roush Fenway Racing.  COLLEGE FOOTBALL   Louisville football signee Dexter Rentz Jr. killed in shooting   Dexter Rentz Jr., a high school senior from Florida who had signed with the Louisville football program, was killed late Saturday night in a shooting in his home state.  Rentz would have played wide receiver for Louisville. Cardinals assistant coach Gunter Brewer had previously said Rentz is ""a great kid"" who he was looking forward to coaching. He would have been a freshman in the upcoming 2020 season.  Rentz was one of four people shot late Saturday in Orlando, according to the Orlando Sentinel. He was the only victim who was killed. Police in Florida had not made any arrests in connection with the shooting as of Sunday morning.  NFL DRAFT   ESPN apologizes for graphic in Tee Higgins' NFL draft bio   The NFL, ESPN and NFL Network combined to pull off the league's 2020 draft remotely this past weekend. By and large, the production received rave reviews from fans and those across the league.  But viewers likely agree on one criticism — ESPN highlighting the sometimes tragic, sometimes traumatic facts about a prospect's personal history. That aspect of the production may not be around in 2021, ESPN senior vice president for production Seth Markman told NBC Sports.  Most of the controversy stemmed from the graphic that aired shortly after the Cincinnati Bengals selected Tee Higgins with the first pick of the second round Friday. The final bullet point highlighted that Higgins' mother fought drug addiction for 16 years.  “The Tee Higgins graphic should not have aired. It was a mistake and we apologize for it,"" Markman said in a statement provided to media outlets. ""We want our draft coverage to personalize players and, where appropriate, acknowledge the obstacles they’ve had to overcome on their journey to the NFL. This graphic lacked proper context.”  ETC.  PATRIOTS: On Monday, longtime Patriots fullback James Develin announced his retirement from football. A three-time Super Bowl champion, Pro Bowler and Brown alum, Develin retires at 31 due to a neck injury that required surgery last fall. Develin played for the Oklahoma City Yard Dawgz of the Arena Football League, playing on defense. He then went to the United Football League, where he transitioned to fullback with the Florida Tuskers. That led him to getting his first break in the NFL."	News

"Former head of AIS has faith FFA's Starting XI won't be just another talkfest  28 Apr 2020, 06:38 by Vince Rugari  Coaching guru Ron Smith predicts a short lifespan for Football Federation Australia's new 'Starting XI' panel if the opinions of those involved are not absorbed by the governing body.  But Smith hopes an ""open door"" policy at FFA, under new chief executive James Johnson, towards former players and coaches will give the advisory panel a chance to shape the sport's future.    Former AIS head coach Ron Smith is part of FFA's new Starting XI advisory panel. Tim Clayton   Smith, the former head of the Australian Institute of Sport football program, is among 11 luminaries to have accepted a position on the Starting XI panel, which will act as a think tank and counsel FFA's football development committee on technical and development matters.  The initiative has been largely well received but there is scepticism among some fans and stakeholders that it is an empty gesture akin to similar recent committees and panels that failed to make an impact.  Johnson's predecessor at FFA, David Gallop, said simply establishing the panel was a reflection of distrust in the national body and an imbalance between the responsibilities of board and management.  ""[If] the stakeholders are [not] confident in the national body set-up ... I think it becomes a bit of a committee-a-thon. More and more committees get created,"" Gallop said on SEN Radio on Tuesday.  ""In rugby, you get a stead of captains who are disillusioned and they form a group . In football, a group's been formed, and they're all well-intentioned, these things, but I think they point to [the fact that] if you get your structure right at the top ... the AFL hasn't had those issues because people are confident in the commission.""  Smith was part of a similar venture during Gallop's reign in 2016 , when he and two ex-players were appointed to FFA's football development committee.  He said it was ""frustrating"" because the committee's discussions were superficial and took place only every three months or so.  ""I went into that one thinking it would provide an opportunity for discussion, like this one ... it was more about rubber-stamping things that were going to the board,"" Smith said.  But Smith expects the Starting XI to be different, citing a ""refreshing"" change of attitude at FFA since Johnson's appointment and a desire to engage with prominent figures in the game.    Ron Smith in 1987, at the AIS with two students who would become professional footballers, Alistair Edwards (left) and David Clarkson. Andrew Campbell   ""I've had so many phone calls and text messages today from people and essentially they're all saying the same thing - 'I hope this whole panel thing works, I hope that FFA listen to what you've got to say,'"" Smith said.  ""My message back has been, 'they've got to, because that's what it's been set up for.'     ""It's not like you can give every ex-player a job at FFA, because that's just not possible, and a lot don't want jobs in the game. I think it's about giving people the opportunity to give their opinion about things ... the only thing I would say is I hope people don't expect everything to be done in the next few weeks.""  Joining Smith on the Starting XI are some forthright personalities, including former Socceroos Mark Viduka, Frank Farina, Paul Okon and Mark Bosnich, and ex-Matildas Joey Peters, Heather Garriock and Connie Selby.  ""If they don't feel they're having any impact at all, they'll say, 'well, we may as well pack it in then',"" Smith said. ""They're going to give up their time and energy for the opportunity to make suggestions about different topics, accepting that they're not the decision-makers.  ""We've never been short of ideas in the game. It's how do you put them into practice? That's the difficult bit."""	NotNews
‘Social Distance’ Series Coming to Netflix From ‘Orange Is the New Black’ Team  28 Apr 2020, 23:30 by Chris Evangelista  Note to Hollywood: maybe, just maybe, we don’t need social distancing-based entertainment right now. Or ever, really. But that won’t stop Netflix, who are moving forward with a “quarantine anthology series” from Orange Is the New Black creator Jenji Kohan . The series is called Social Distance , and promises to focus on the “new, bizarre, bewildering reality we are all experiencing.”  Whether we like it or not, we’re bound to get more than a few coronavirus/social distancing-themed movies and TV shows in the not-too-distant future. Case in point: Netflix just ordered Social Distance , a “quarantine anthology series” from the production team behind Orange Is the New Black . And what’s it about? There’s no info on that yet.  Here’s what we do know: everything is being done remotely. Director Diego Velasco will direct from home, while showrunner Hilary Weisman Graham runs the show from her abode and the cast films themselves at their respective domiciles. Graham, Jenji Kohan, Tara Herrmann, and Blake McCormick all serve as executive producers (and, you guessed it, they’ll be executive producing from home).  The team behind the show released the following statement:  We feel passionate about finding connection as we all remain at a distance. We’ve been inspired to create an anthology series that tells stories about the current moment we are living through — the unique, personal, deeply human stories that illustrate how we are living apart, together. We are challenging ourselves to do something new: To create and produce virtually so that our cast and crew can stay healthy and safe.  The experience of social distancing is currently universal, but no individual story is the same. Through a broad spectrum of tales and moments, some seismic and some mundane, we hope to capture a moment in time. And we hope that Social Distance will help people feel closer to one another.  All Netflix productions have shut down for the time being, and they could stay that way for the foreseeable future. With that in mind, I suppose it makes sense for the streaming service to be all-in on an idea like this. But that doesn’t make it a good idea. To be fair, the distinct lack of actual info regarding the show isn’t helping things either, and maybe Social Distance will surprise us all.	News
Here's when the daytime soap operas will run out of new episodes  28 Apr 2020, 12:30 by Nola Ojomu  The moment soap opera fans have been dreading has arrived as daytime dramas officially run out of new episodes.  Thanks to the unexpected speed in which lockdown laws came into place due to the coronavirus pandemic, many film studios were forced to halt production in March – with only a few weeks’ worth of episodes in their locker.  CBS has been the hardest hit and they quickly confirmed that both The Young and the Restless and The Bold and the Beautiful would run out of new material while we’re all still in quarantine.  And the fateful day came on Thursday, 23 April – however there’s still going to be something on to help fans get through it all.  We take a look at what the plan is for each of the soaps in the coming weeks.   General Hospital     General Hospital will run out of new shows in May (Picture: ABC)   General Hospital is still airing new episodes from Monday to Thursday each week, with a special Flashback Friday episodes helping to ease the pressure.  These Friday episodes are a mix of repeat shows and all-time classics.  While the new episodes have had a bit of an extra edit to weave in flashbacks from previously aired shows, making the most out of already-shot material as well as making sure fans are completely up to speed with all the drama going down.  But even with all they have done, the ABC soap is reported to run out of new episodes around the end of May.   General Hospital airs weekdays at 12pm on ABC.    The Young and the Restless     The Young and The Restless has run out of new material (Picture: CBS)   The soap officially ran out of new material after the show aired on Thursday, 23 April.  But in some good news for those feeling a bit nostalgic right now, CBS is filling the void by dipping into their extensive library.  There will be a theme each week to help fans enjoy a mix of vintage episodes and memorable storylines.   The Young and the Restless airs weekdays from 12.30pm ET on CBS.    The Bold and the Beautiful     And so has The Bold and the Beautiful (Picture: CBS)   Just like YR, the show aired its last new episode on 23 April.  Again fans will be taken on a trip down memory lane but the throwback episodes will also have bonus content such as commentary at the beginning and end of the show.  The theme for each week for both YR and B&B will be announced as time goes on.  The Bold and the Beautiful airs weekdays from 1.30pm ET  on CBS.   Days of Our Lives     While Days of Our Lives has enough film to last until October (Picture: NBC)   Sand might be running through the hourglass much faster for the other soaps, but Days of Our Lives is able to hang on for much longer.  Thanks to their filming schedule, the soap actually has enough new material to keep going until October according to reports.  In fact, sources tell The Wrap that the soap was just about to tape their Halloween episode when production got shut down.  So there still going to be some new soap drama to last through the summer.   Days of Our Lives airs weekdays at 1pm (ET) on NBC.    Got A Showbiz Story?

Opinion  Should you be checking your own oxygen levels if you have coronavirus symptoms?  Oximeters measure the oxygen in blood. As a GP I think they are useful, but there’s more to assessing how sick you are  28 Apr 2020, 12:01 by Ann Robinson    Coronavirus – latest updates    See all our coronavirus coverage    Covid-19 is proving to be a many-headed monster. And though most people will steadily improve and recover, a small percentage (up 4%) suffer a precipitous, unpredicted and sometimes delayed decline. Experts are warning that waiting for the “classic” symptoms – difficulty in breathing and high fever – may mean that some cases of pneumonia and other complications may be missed. But how do you know whether you’re the one who will need hospitalisation? Will you end up in ICU? How do you know when you’re out of the woods? And are there any specific ways of assessing whether you’re getting better or worse?  Most of us can put up with the sweats, aches, cough and deep fatigue for a few days if we know that we’ll turn the corner and begin a couple of weeks of gradual recovery. Michael, a 27-year-old coronavirus patient, told me: “At first, it was like wading through a sea of treacle just to reach the loo. I felt like a small child was sitting on my chest so that breathing was really hard work. Then after a couple of days, my breathing eased and I could potter around my flat like my grandmother does, though a bit slower. The thought of going out for a 5K run, which I used to do in about 24 minutes, still feels impossible. But I’m in my third week and I can feel that I’m on the mend. I wish that someone had told me that it would take this long because not knowing is really scary.”  As Michael’s GP, I would have been the obvious person to advise him on what to expect. But the truth is that the presentations, complications and consequences of this novel virus are still unfolding; the initial phone triage pathway that doctors like me were advised to follow at the start of the crisis was pragmatic and generally safe but didn’t cover the myriad exceptions to the rule that have since become apparent.  One concern is that pneumonia can develop, which only causes symptoms of shortness of breath once it is at an advanced stage. Pneumonia occurs when the tiny air sacs in the lungs (alveoli) become inflamed by a virus, bacteria, fungus or irritant particle and fill with fluid or pus, making it hard to breathe. Too little oxygen in the lungs means that the blood can’t pick up enough to carry to every organ and cell in the body (resulting in a condition called hypoxia). Sustained hypoxia causes organ failure and cell death. Administering oxygen via a mask or CPAP machine can help at first but if the alveoli are too bunged up then no amount of oxygen will help and mechanical breathing assistance (ventilation) becomes necessary.  It can be hard to know when a chest infection that affects bigger airways but leaves the alveoli able to function is developing into a potentially dangerous pneumonia. Pointers are a temperature over 37.8C, a pulse rate over 100 beats per minute, crackling sounds heard through a stethoscope and oxygen saturation levels in the blood lower than 95%. A chest X-ray or CT scan may also show abnormalities that point to pneumonia. But none of these is entirely reliable on its own; for example, your pulse rate may be high if you’re unfit, anxious, have just consumed caffeine or have a fever from any cause.  Oxygen saturation levels are a measure of how much oxygen is getting round your body and can be fairly reliably assessed with a little gadget called a pulse oximeter that clips on to your finger. Two wavelengths of lights are emitted by an LED inside the device on one side of the finger. The light that passes through the fingertip is measured and the amount that has been absorbed by the oxygen in the blood is calculated to give an oxygen saturation – or “sats” – reading. A figure is displayed, which is the percentage of the maximum amount of oxygen that the blood should carry, and the ingenious little gadget – which runs on one AAA battery – also displays heart rate.  Pulse oximetry is a useful adjunct in deciding who needs treatment, admission to hospital, oxygen therapy, a transfer to intensive care, ventilation and then, at the other end of the tunnel, who can be safely discharged home and reassured that they’re on the mend. Oximeters don’t work well if your hands are cold, you have shellac on your nails or the battery is flat.  Anyone who is too breathless to complete a sentence, has severe chest pain, is drowsy, confused or unable to stand up due to dizziness will need urgent assessment, usually with a 999 call. Relying on a sats measurement isn’t safe if you’re clearly seriously unwell and deteriorating. But in a more borderline call, a sats reading of over 96%, a heart rate under 90 beats per minute and a respiratory rate of under 20 breaths per minute are reassuring.  GP surgeries have been given pulse oximeters to lend to patients at home to monitor their progress either as the infection is developing or as recovery kicks in. We’ve only got two for 5,000 patients and had a bit of difficulty getting one of them back from a patient who understandably wanted to hang on to it. You can buy them online or from some pharmacies (costing £20-60) and there are a lot of Chinese-made ones on eBay.  But the real message isn’t to rush out to bag a pulse oximeter at all costs. The message is that this Hydra of a virus can present in insidious ways, especially in the frail and elderly. If you are feeling increasingly ill, confused or drowsy, don’t wait until you can’t breathe or until the pulse oximeter arrives. Get help: call 111 or your GP as a first step if you can, and 999 if it feels like you can’t wait.   Ann Robinson is a GP	NotNews
How Will Heroines Accommodate our Heroes?  28 Apr 2020, 12:00 by Sridhar Raavi, By Mirchi9     Once the lockdown comes to a halt, our heroes can directly go back to their respective projects and begin shooting immediately. Speaking of which, can out heroines accommodate dates for them immediately?  Usually, our heroes do a film at a time. In the heroines’ case, it’s quite different as they sign up for different films that would be shot simultaneously. So, most of the heroines who have multiple projects in hand, hop from one project to another juggling between different projects.  For example, once the lockdown halts, Pooja Hegde has two projects, one with Prabhas and the other with Akhil. That means she has got to accommodate both the movies.  Alia Bhatt , one of the heroines of RRR, has to accommodate dates for Rajamouli’s prestigious project and also her other big Bollywood commitments. Not just Alia Bhatt, Deverakonda-Puri’s heroine Ananya Pandey is also a Mumbai girl.  So, it’s not about lifting lockdown in Hyderabad. The situation in Mumbai might be different and it’s to be seen if our heroines like Kajal Agarwal, Tamannaah Bhatia etc. who live there can come down for shooting. A lot is left for speculation, as of now.	NotNews

Minister: Communications Ministry will fine-tune compulsory screening to stimulate film industry post-MCO   28 Apr 2020, 12:05   KUALA LUMPUR, April 28 ― The Ministry of Communications and Multimedia (KKMM) will fine-tune the implementation of the compulsory screening scheme or any new incentive to stimulate the film industry post-Covid-19.  Its minister Datuk Saifuddin Abdullah said for this, KKMM would hold special talks with the National Film Development Corporation Malaysia (Finas) and industry players to devise a rescreening mechanism and measures to help them meet the challenges and revitalise the industry.  “We at KKMM are aware of the situation faced by the film industry as a result of the Covid-19 outbreak and the implementation of the movement control order (MCO),” he said in a statement today.  In the meantime, following an issue on the viralling of a Compulsory Screening Committee information video, Saifuddin said Finas had been directed to remove the video.  He said the decision was made to avoid misunderstandings, as it seemed to give the impression of a promise of implementation when it was not certain.  ‘’I have directed the management (of Finas) to take down the video after receiving several reactions from film industry players,” he said. ― Bernama   Related Articles	News
UK Sort of Cheats to 18-Day Coal-Free Electricity Record  28 Apr 2020, 12:30 by Gary Cutlack  Our laptops being on at home a bit more than usual is not balancing out the drop in power demand caused by the shutdown of the country's schools and offices, funnily enough, as power need is so low that we've hit another coal-off generation milestone.  The National Grid says we've gone around 18 and a half days without the backup coal burners being riddled into life by that old bloke who smells of smoke, thanks to a combination of sunny weather, everything being more efficient than it was, and 80 per cent of everything else being switched off. Still, a record's a record, even if this one's assisted in a small way by the small one-off tailwind of a global pandemic.  If you are excited about this you probably already have the Grid's Carbon Intensity app on your smart device, because that lets us see the makeup of the UK's power generation mix via a feed of real time information from the generators. It's probably cheap to put the washing machine on in the day now, for example, seeing as the factories aren't using as much. [ National Grid ]	News
"UK coronavirus death toll rises by 633 taking total to 21,749  28 Apr 2020, 13:03 by Chris Kitching, https://www.mirror.co.uk/authors/chris-kitching/  Britain's coronavirus hospital death toll has climbed to 21,749 after 633 new fatalities were reported, but the daily total continues to trend downwards.  England reported 546 new deaths, Scotland had 70 and Wales recorded 17. Northern Ireland has not yet announced its latest totals.  The previous daily totals were 360 on Monday and 373 on Sunday, although those figures were lower because many weekend deaths are not reported by hospitals until later.  The latest figures were announced after a minute's silence was held to remember the more than 100 health, care and other key workers who have died during the crisis.  New figures show more than 6,500 coronavirus-related deaths have occurred outside hospitals in England and Wales, and the Scottish Government has recommended wearing face masks in public in ""limited circumstances"".    Have you been affected by coronavirus? Email webnews@mirror.co.uk.      Staff react outside Salford Royal Hospital in Manchester during a minute's silence on Tuesday (Image: PA)   A total of 1,332 patients have died in Scotland after testing positive for coronavirus, up by 70 from 1,262 on Monday, said First Minister Nicola Sturgeon.  She said 10,721 people have now tested positive for the virus in Scotland, up by 200 from 10,521 the day before.  There are 126 people in intensive care with coronavirus or coronavirus symptoms and 1,754 people are in hospital with confirmed or suspected Covid-19.  Ms Sturgeon added 2,448 people who tested positive for coronavirus have now been able to leave hospital.  After announcing the figures, she said the Scottish Government was now recommending the wearing face masks in public in ""limited circumstances"".  It is not recommending the use of face masks for children under the age of two.  The First Minister added: ""We are recommending that you do wear a cloth face covering if you are in an enclosed space with others where social distancing is difficult, for example public transport or in a shop.""  The UK Government is yet to make a decision on whether to recommend face coverings, Downing Street said.  More than 6,500 deaths involving coronavirus have occurred in England and Wales outside of hospital, official figures show.  Care homes notified the Care Quality Commission (CQC) of 4,343 deaths of residents in homes between April 10 and 24 in England, the Office for National Statistics (ONS) said.  It is the first time the CQC death notifications for suspected or confirmed Covid-19 in care homes have been published.  Care providers said it is clear the ""epicentre of this crisis is in care homes"" and that the sector is ""sadly the most affected area of society in terms of deaths from Covid-19"".  Prior to April 10, there were 1,000 deaths registered in care homes, Nick Stripe, head of health analysis, told the BBC.  An expert helping advise the Government on the coronavirus outbreak has told MPs he would be ""terribly worried"" about lifting lockdown measures with no or limited knowledge of the population's immunity against Covid-19.  Danny Altmann, professor of immunology at Imperial College London, told the Commons Science and Technology Committee that a better understanding of immunity in the population could help ease current restrictions on leaving the home.  But he said he was concerned about proceeding with lifting current restrictions with limited or no knowledge of how many people are immune to the virus.  He said: ""As an immunologist and knowing how desperately lethal this virus can be, I'd be very worried about any assumptions on those grounds - terribly worried.""    An NHS worker wearing personal protective equipment (PPE) (Image: Getty Images)   He added: ""For a virus we've known about since January, it's been a very steep learning curve.  ""Without really good antibody testing and seroprevalence (rates of antibodies) in the population, we're flying blind.  ""We haven't got a clue who's had it, how many have had it, where they've had it, or where we stand for the future for second waves, so I can't emphasise sufficiently how desperately we need that data and how widely we need that data.""  Prof Altmann said current data was so diverse it looked like somebody had ""fired a scattergun on the page"".  But he said tentative early assessments of the data suggested there were low levels of immunity in those who fell ill, as well as ""most of us in the community"" who had only been exposed to ""very little"" of the virus.

Sonic movie director would “Love to do more with Sonic cinematic universe” and characters  28 Apr 2020, 13:46 by Sickr     The Sonic the Hedgehog Movie could easily be declared a success after a troubled start. USA Today caught up with the film’s director Jeff Fowler to find out what’s next for the spiky blue hedgehog. Fowler suggests that if there is another Sonic the Hedgehog Movie the next would feature more characters from the Sonic universe like Tails and Knuckles etc. However, he does insist there’s no official talks or plans for a sequel.  “There’s so many more great characters to bring in and just more stories to tell,” says director Jeff Fowler, who calls the “Sonic” saga a “remarkable journey.” He insists that there are no official talks or plans for a sequel. “(But) nothing would bring me more happiness than getting another shot with these characters and to tell more stories. We’d love to do more with the Sonic cinematic universe,.” “We would get that question a lot from fans, ‘Is Tails in it? Is Knuckles in it?’ All these fan-favorite characters,” says Fowler. “We had to do that little fan Easter egg with Tails and say, ‘We know you love these characters. We will absolutely get to them in future stories if we’re able to.’ “   Source	NotNews

"Chinese govt says students must wear 1-meter long hat to maintain social distancing   28 Apr 2020, 13:36    - The Chinese government has said all its school children must wear one-metre hats for social distancing sake    - The hats which have sticks at both sides discourage any form of close contact with the hat owner    - According to the government, the children are also not to make physical contacts with their mates on touch the hats   Daily Mail reports that the Chinese government has mandated their students to wear one-meter hats as a way to keep social distancing in their classrooms after schools resumed from a three-month lockdown.  A video seen by the media shows how the hats are made with sticks on both ends to ensure that nobody comes close to the wearer at one metre.  The government is putting up this unconventional method as it continues to seek ways to ease the lockdown that has been active for three months.  It should be noted that the idea of the hats was mooted by the Yangzheng Primary School in Hangzhou in Zhejiang province of China after it welcomed year 1 to 3 students back on campus on Sunday, April 26.

A picture showing the kids with the hats sitting in their classroom. Photo source: Daily Mail Source: UGC   Another thing worthy of note is that the teacher had instructed the students to make the hat with their parents at home before coming to school.  The students are also banned from having any physical contact with their classmates and must also not touch their hats.  Meanwhile, Legit.ng earlier reported that Boris Johnson, the prime minister of the UK, released a statement outside the popular 10 Downing Street on coronavirus situation in the country .

"FATF gives Pakistan 4-month reprieve to meet deadline to stop financing terror groups  28 Apr 2020, 14:03 by Elizabeth Roche   FATF warns it would not be relaxing its efforts to combat the financing of terrorist organizations  Other nations on FATF’s watch also get a four-month reprieve for meeting a deadline to stop financing terrorist groups   NEW DELHI : The Paris-based Financial Action Task Force (FATF) on Tuesday said it was giving countries on its watch including Pakistan a four-month reprieve for meeting a deadline set by it to stop financing terrorist group given the temporary suspension of its activities due to the crisis caused by the novel coronavirus pandemic.  But the intergovernmental body, that sets policies and standards to combat financial crime including money laundering and terrorist financing, warned that it would not be relaxing its efforts to combat the financing of terrorist organizations or any of its other activities.  It said in a statement posted on its website that it would actively monitor the impact of the covid-19 crisis on measures to counter illicit financing.  In the statement, the FATF said it had “decided on a general pause in the review process for the list of high-risk jurisdictions subject to a call for action and jurisdictions subject to increased monitoring, by granting jurisdictions an additional four months for deadlines.""  “Thus, the FATF is not reviewing them in June,"" the statement said, adding the organisation’s plenary had agreed to “temporarily postpone all remaining FATF mutual evaluations and follow-up deadlines.""  Pakistan was not mentioned by name but diplomats based in New Delhi said that the statement meant that Pakistan was among the countries that would get more time to implement the deadlines set by the FATF. This comes as the FATF and its members have been not been able to visit countries for a first hand assessment of the implementation of action plans because of travel restrictions imposed countries around the world top stem the spread of the pandemic, one of the diplomats cited above said. Pakistan’s performance was to be assessed at a meeting in Beijing in June but now it is expected to happen later this year.  Pakistan has been on FATF’s “grey list"" of “jurisdictions"" closely watched and monitored since June 2018 for failing to stop the flow of money to terorirst organizations like the Lashkar-e-Taiba (LeT) and Jaish-e-Mohammed (JeM) besides the al-Qaeda and Haqqani Network.  At a plenary meeting of the FATF in Paris in February, Pakistan had been warned that it had till June to meet its deadlines for a 27-point action plan. The FATF had also concluded that Islamabad had “largely addressed"" only 14 of the 27 points in the action plan. It had then issued a warning to Pakistan that if its action plan is not fully implemented, it would face the possibility of being moved to the list of monitored countries, commonly known as the “black list.""  “Despite the decision to temporarily postpone the above-mentioned process deadlines due to the current force majeure situation, the FATF will not let up its efforts to fight money laundering, terrorist financing and proliferation financing, and will continue working with all jurisdictions in its global network to ensure an effective implementation of its standards,"" the FATF statement said.  “The FATF is actively monitoring the impact of the Covid-19 crisis on measures to combat illicit financing. We remain vigilant to the threats posed by criminals and terrorists who may seek to exploit this period to further their criminal objectives,"" it said.  “This situation has significantly impacted countries’ ability to actively participate in mutual evaluation and related follow-up processes. The FATF Plenary acknowledges these severe challenges that countries face at this difficult time,"" it added.  Click here to read the Mint ePaper Livemint.com is now on Telegram.

RAF flypast for Captain Tom’s 100th birthday   28 Apr 2020, 14:21    Timings of the flypast have not been publicised amid fears that crowds could gather to view the spectacle.     Captain Tom Moore's 100th birthday will be marked by an RAF flypast (Joe Giddens/PA)   Captain Tom Moore’s 100th birthday will be marked by an RAF flypast.  The Ministry of Defence (MoD) confirmed the Battle of Britain Memorial Flight (BBMF) will carry out an aerial salute on Thursday after Captain Tom raised £29 million for the NHS by walking laps of his garden.  This will replace a flypast over his Bedfordshire home planned by a Spitfire restoration company in Kent.  Timings of the BBMF flypast have not been publicised amid fears that crowds could gather to view the spectacle.  An MoD spokesman said: “Weather permitting, aircraft from the RAF Battle of Britain Memorial Flight will complete a flypast to celebrate Captain Tom’s birthday and mark his amazing fundraising achievement.  “The great British public is encouraged to follow Captain Tom’s disciplined example and not gather to watch the flypast but continue following PHE (Public Health England) guidelines on social distancing.”  The BBMF, based at RAF Coningsby in Lincolnshire, features various aircraft, including six Spitfires and a Lancaster bomber.  Kent’s Biggin Hill Heritage Hangar, which restores Spitfires, said in a statement it was denied permission for its flight by the Department for Transport due to the coronavirus lockdown.  It added: “Getting a Spitfire overhead for Captain Tom was always the primary goal and we’re thrilled that this may still be possible.”  Transport Secretary Grant Shapps claimed the flypast means Captain Tom will be honoured “in an even more significant way”.    Captain Tom Moore’s grandson, Benjie Ingram-Moore, in the Great Hall of Bedford School (Joe Giddens/PA)   He wrote on Twitter that it was “meant to be a surprise for Tom”, but confirmed it would be happening after it emerged his department had rejected the original planned flypast.  A school in Bedfordshire has been flooded with more than 125,000 cards from well-wishers across the globe for Captain Tom’s birthday.  Famous names including the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge, Dame Kelly Holmes and England football captain Harry Kane were among those to send cards to Bedford School, where Captain Tom’s grandson, Benjie Ingram-Moore, is a pupil.     Benjie turned to his school for help when he learned that the post office was being swamped with cards.  The 16-year-old said: “The volume of cards that have been sent to granddad is just astonishing. So many of the cards are truly heartfelt, with thousands from young children who have taken the time to use their artistic talent and write a personal message.  “Another £60,000 has been generously donated via his birthday cards.  “It means a lot to granddad as well as us as a family. We are hugely proud of how the nation has taken granddad to its heart. Words can’t express how much I idolise him.”  Royal portrait artist Darren Baker has presented Captain Tom with a pastel portrait of himself and a sketch of Keighley, West Yorkshire, where the 99-year-old grew up.  Mr Baker, from Huddersfield, said: “We chatted for ages about Yorkshire. He was over the moon – his smile is as warm as his heart.”	News
"Norwegian billionaire held over wife's disappearance   28 Apr 2020, 14:23   Norwegian police said Tuesday they had arrested a wealthy businessman over the disappearance of his wife 18 months ago, the latest twist in a case that has kept the Nordic countries on tenterhooks.

Hagen's wife Anne-Elisabeth Hagen disappeared without a trace from their home in Lorenskog, east of Oslo, on 31 October, 2018.  A poorly written ransom note, containing threats and a demand for nine million euros in crypto currency, was found at the scene. Sporadic contact with the alleged kidnappers on digital platforms initially supported the theory that she had been the victim of a rogue abduction.  However, by June 2019, police were re-evaluating their leads and started examining whether it was a murder that had been disguised as a kidnapping. Tom Hagen is the 164th richest man in Norway with an estimated net worth of 1.9 billion Norwegian kroner (€168 million) in 2019, according to business magazine Kapital.  His lawyer said he denied the allegations.  ""He forcefully maintains that he has nothing to do with it,"" Svein Holden told public broadcaster NRK.  Police did not present any concrete evidence to support their suspicions or speculate on a potential motive, but said the case ""had traces of a clear, premeditated misdirection.""  Question marks remain as to what police believe Tom Hagen's exact role in the disappearance to be, whether he had accomplices and the whereabouts of Anne-Elisabeth Hagen, now presumed dead.  Police said they had yet to interrogate the suspect."	News
"Canceling a cruise due to coronavirus? Here’s a list of updated policies  28 Apr 2020, 14:57 by Callie Patteson          1 / 2  Just like the cancellations of airline flights to Asian and European countries, travelers with reservations on several cruise lines may be worried by the growing spread of COVID-19, the disease caused by the novel coronavirus.  On March 19, the State Department raised the global travel advisory to level 4: Do not travel. According to the department's advisory, ""U.S. citizens who live in the United States should arrange for immediate return to the United States, unless they are prepared to remain abroad for an indefinite period.""  Cruise Lines International Association, the world's largest cruise industry trade organization, announced on March 4 that additional screening measures will be taken in response to the spread of the disease. Cruise lines that are members of CLIA include Disney Cruise Line, Norwegian Cruise Line and Royal Caribbean International. Effective immediately, these companies and all other CLIA members must follow these guidelines:   Deny boarding to all people who have traveled from, visited or transited via airports in South Korea, Iran, China (including Hong Kong and Macao) and any municipality in Italy subject to quarantine within 14 days before embarkation.  Conduct illness screenings for all people who have traveled from, visited or transited through airports in any destination listed on the CDC's coronavirus disease 2019 information for travel page within 14 days before embarkation.  Deny boarding to all persons who, within 14 days before embarkation, have had contact with or helped care for anyone suspected or diagnosed with having COVID-19.  Conduct preboarding screening necessary to effectuate these prevention measures.   If you are looking to cancel your trip, be sure to check your cruise line's cancellation policy (or travel insurance coverage ). While it varies from company to company, most cruise lines will refund a portion of what you paid. However, the closer it gets to your departure date, the smaller that refund will be, and in some cases, that amount could be zero.  Below is a list of the latest policies by major cruise lines for boarding as well as updated cancellation policies. Find out if your trip might be impacted:  Carnival Cruise Line  Carnival is suspending all sailings departing March 13 through June 26 across all North America-based ships. Guests affected by the suspension will receive a 100% refund of future cruise credit or in the original payment. Depending on the cruise length, guests who choose the future cruise credit will also be given onboard credit to use on their next cruise as long as it is booked by Dec. 31 for sailings before Dec. 31, 2022.  As a CLIA member, Carnival is complying with all screening and operational protocols listed above but is extending the restrictions to 20 days before embarkation and including Japan and Singapore on its list of restricted countries. Carnival will be taking the temperatures of all guests and crew.  Guests who keep their booking for any departures between March 6 and May 31 will receive onboard credit. The amounts vary on the length of each cruise, but start at a minimum of $100 and will be automatically applied.  Carnival is also allowing guests who are on a cruise departing during March to cancel up to three days before sailing — as long as they made their booking on or before March 5. Guests who are sailing in April and made their booking on or before March 5 have until March 31 to cancel their trip.

Royal Caribbean International  Royal Caribbean has announced a voluntary suspension of cruising worldwide, effective March 15. The decision comes two days after deciding to suspend departures from U.S. ports on March 13. Guests currently onboard a cruise will not be affected. They plan to resume operations on May 12.

Rancher: U.S. Importing Beef While Prepping to Possibly Discard American Herds  28 Apr 2020, 22:55 by Bob.Price.Texas, Bob Price  A rancher who raises cattle in Texas and Colorado sounded the alarm that the U.S. government is importing what he considered inferior beef from Namibia while American ranchers are facing the possible “depopulation” of their herds.  “Yesterday (April 26), the first shipment of imported beef from the country of Namibia hit the shores of the United States of America,” Rancher Shad Sullivan said in a video posted on Twitter. “And yet, this morning, they (U.S. Department of Agriculture) are telling us to prepare to euthanize harvest-ready cattle.”     “Am I the only one that sees a problem with this?” Sullivan asked. “It is time we get the American people back to work. It is time we get money flowing. It is time we get food on the shelves.”  Breitbart Texas contacted Sullivan about what prompted his impassioned video.  “On Sunday, the U.S. Department of Agriculture promised to help cattle producers find alternative markets for livestock producers after several meatpacking plants shut down over Coronavirus concerns. They followed that saying that if alternative markets cannot be found, they would ‘advise and assist on depopulation and disposal methods.'”  Sullivan said ranchers and farmers are facing unprecedented times where chicken and hogs are being destroyed, harvest-ready crops are being plowed under, and milk is being poured on the ground by the hundreds of thousands of gallons.  The Texas rancher told Breitbart the U.S. government is importing inferior beef from countries like Namibia while American ranchers are facing the possible euthanasia of the cattle that are now ready to take in for processing.  “The American public won’t know what they are getting,” Sullivan explained. “There is currently no ‘County of Origin’ labeling requirement on beef packaging.”  “We face losing our cattle and millions of dollars invested while food processors are making record profits,” he concluded.  On Tuesday, President Donald Trump announced he will sign an executive order declaring meat-producing plants as “critical infrastructure,” Breitbart News reported . The president is using the authority granted under the Defense Production Act to order companies to stay open. The order will also provide protective gear for the workers of the plants.  “We’ll probably have that today solved,” Trump said. “It was a very unique circumstance because of liability.”  In the meantime, Sullivan says his cattle are “harvest-ready” with nowhere to go.  Bob Price serves as associate editor and senior news contributor for the Breitbart Texas-Border team . He is an original member of the Breitbart Texas team.

Police to deploy additional officers to monitor easing restrictions, Gold Coast  28 Apr 2020, 22:46 by Monique StClair  Queensland Police will be beefing up their presence on the Gold Coast this weekend, as coronavirus restrictions begin to ease.  From midnight Friday, Queenslanders will be allowed to go for a picnic, visit a national park, and go recreational fishing or boating.  However, only members of a house hold are able to be together outside of the home, or if you live alone you can only be out with one other person.  Social distancing measures must still be followed at all times.  It’s due to the consistently low numbers of new cases diagnosed across the state, proving that we’ve done a great job of ‘flattening the curve’.  Though officials don’t want all our hard work to go to waste, and will increase the amount of officers out and about, making sure that no one flaunts the new rules.  140 additional officers will be deployed across the Gold Coast and Brisbane, targeting gathering hot spots.  Police Commissioner Katarina Carroll says the easing restrictions may seem like a small step, but to police, it’s a big one.  “What we are doing this weekend, we do have a police operation where we do have an additional 140 police officers out there to make sure that the public is abiding by all the restrictions.  “Please ensure that, although there is an easing, there are still conditions that do apply here.  “There is the social distancing rule, as well as the 50 kilometre radius, as well as the fact that it has to be with people of your own household or one other person,” Commissioner Carroll said.  State Disastor Coordinator Steve Gollschewski says they’ll be targeting certain areas.  “You will see additional police out this weekend (sic) on Gold Coast and in Brisbane so 140, but that’s in addition to the normal police who are out as well.  “And those officers will be concentrating on the areas where we know people gather in large groups, think South Bank, New Farm Park, Surfers Paradise, those sorts of places.  “You can expect to see police officers there ensuring you’re doing the right thing. We do not want to see large congregations in any areas,” Mr Gollschewski said.	News
Retail bonds guarantee staggering returns  At the current 11.5% pa on a five-year bond, reinvesting the proceeds results in a period-effective rate of 14.4%.  28 Apr 2020, 22:12 by Riaz Gardee  The Chinese word for crisis, weiji, has often been mistranslated as comprising two symbols denoting danger and opportunity to highlight that many opportunities arise in times of danger.  Fortunes are lost and made during times of crisis where steady minds are rewarded for their objectivity.  With markets in turmoil and interest rates rapidly declining, one such opportunity is available until the end of April.  RSA Retail Bonds issued by National Treasury currently pay an impressive 11.5% per annum on a five-year bond.  Interest can be reinvested, paid semi-annually or monthly if you are over 60 years old.   The key   Reinvesting the proceeds results in a period effective rate of 14.4% due to the magical effect of compounding; a R100 000 original investment returning R174 500 (1.745x) at the end of the five years.  Most people are unable to instinctively think in terms of compounding as has been demonstrated by the exponential growth of the Covid-19 virus.  Warren Buffett has always highlighted the magic of compounding growth over long periods of time and his advice to investors has always been to combine it with low fees.  A government-guaranteed risk-free rate of 11.5% per annum for five years with zero fees certainly meets these criteria.  There are also two- and three-year bonds yielding 7.75% and 9% per annum respectively.   Bonds beat banks right now   The RSA Retail Bond rate of 11.5% is significantly higher than the current commercial banks rate of circa 6-7%, making it a compelling long-term savings initiative by government.  Pensioners and savers who depend on rand income for their rand savings will breathe a sigh of reprieve at this opportunity, with interest rates generally having sharply declined in synch with the central bank lowering rates.  To generate a similar return one would need approximately 1.8x more capital at a commercial bank.   Unique tax aspect   One needs to also consider their unique tax circumstances as shown in the illustrative example below:     Under 65 yrs  Over 65 yrs    Bond value  R930 000  R1 420 000    Yield  11.5%  11.5%    Income  R106 950  R163 300    Exempt interest  (R23 800)  (R34 500)    Taxable income  R83 150  R128 800         Tax @ 18%  R14 967  R23 184    Tax rebate  (R14 958)  (R23 157)    Tax due  R9  R27    Assuming no other income bonds of R930 000 for those under the age of 65 and R1.4 million for those over 65, the interest in this example would be exempt from taxes due to interest exemptions and rebates. Minors also qualify for investing if their parents apply on their behalf. At these levels of investment an 11.5% nominal, or 14.4% if reinvested, would be the net return to the investor.   Who would typically fit the investor profile?    Requires rand income to cover expenses;  Has rand savings available to deploy;  A long-term investor (or willing to pay a one-period interest penalty to exit after 12 months);  Has long-term rand requirements;  No appetite for volatility and requires predetermined fixed outcomes;  A low-risk investor; and  Has a minimum investment amount of only R1 000.   Bond investments are an often overlooked asset class with returns comparable or even exceeding the JSE in recent years. In the wise words of Buffett ‘Beware the investment activity that produces applause; the great moves are usually greeted by yawns.’  Applications and payments can be made online ( here ) to qualify for the April rates. Rates are set and fixed per month, and could decline in May.   Riaz Gardee is a mergers and acquisitions specialist and financial writer.

Your daily horoscope: April 29  29 Apr 2020, 04:01 by Sally Brompton    Taurus.   IF TODAY IS YOUR BIRTHDAY  You must not be vague about your ambitions. Make a point of defining precisely what it is you wish to accomplish in life, then draw up a plan that will take you from where you are now to where you most want to be. After that it should be easy.  ARIES (March 21 - April 20):  Yes, some of your dreams have taken a bit of a knock of late but it’s not the end of the world so keep smiling and keep striving. As one opportunity ends so another will present itself, but you won’t see it if you’re looking in the wrong direction.  TAURUS (April 21 - May 21):  You are no longer at the mercy of events – well, not to the extent that you were before – and are no doubt looking for ways to express yourself. Don’t do the same sort of things all over again, do something a bit different, maybe even a touch outrageous!  GEMINI (May 22 - June 21):  There is no point worrying about things you cannot change, so put whatever is causing so much anxiety out of your mind and focus on something you can use your intelligence and ingenuity to influence. Always be positive and always look forward.  CANCER (June 22 - July 23):  No matter how bad a crisis situation appears to be you must not let it worry you personally. In the greater scheme of things what seems so important now will one day be viewed as of minor significance, so why not make that one day today?  LEO (July 24 - Aug. 23):  It may annoy you that certain people are getting emotionally worked up about something that does not mean much to you, but try to see the situation from their point of view. It could be they have a lot more to lose, so maybe show some sympathy?  VIRGO (Aug. 24 - Sept. 23):  As usual you have taken on too much work and, as usual, you are now wishing you had learned the art of saying “no”. Order your tasks in terms of importance and work through them one by one. In the meantime, don’t agree to do anything more!  LIBRA (Sept. 24 - Oct. 23):  If you want to get things done over the next few days you will have to offer to meet partners and colleagues halfway. That should not be difficult for someone with your talent for compromise, and you have a proven track record for reliability.  SCORPIO (Oct. 24 - Nov. 22):  If you have made an error of some kind then you would be wise to own up to it now. If you leave it even a day or two you may find that people are not so forgiving. Everyone makes mistakes from time to time – no one expects you to be perfect.  SAGITTARIUS (Nov. 23 - Dec. 21):  If an offer seems too good to be true then give it a miss. Always listen to your inner voice and always act on what it tells you, because it is the link between your conscious mind and a greater reality – a reality that may be more real than this one.  CAPRICORN (Dec. 22 - Jan. 20):  This is a good time for both creative activities and affairs of the heart, and if you can find ways to link the two over the next few days it could be one of the happiest periods of the year. What you do with others will bring untold joy.

"A new Australian envoy could break the impasse with China   29 Apr 2020, 04:12   Relations are at a low ebb with the People’s Republic of China, and the COVID-19 pandemic offers little prospect of a turning tide anytime soon. Ambassador Cheng Jingye’s implied threat of a Chinese consumer boycott of Australian products marks a new low. Those hoping to steer Australia’s troubled relationship towards less turbulent waters face no easy task.  The impasse must be broken. The appointment of a Special PRC Envoy would signal the Prime Minister’s determination to get relations with China back on track.    The Australia-China relationship needs to be moved to a better place. Alex Ellinghausen   Calls to decouple Australia’s economy from China are blind to the reality of global supply chains and the laws of supply and demand. Unless there is an unlikely spike in demand for Australian goods and services from other nations in the region, China will remain – by order of considerable magnitude – Australia’s most critical trading partner. Merely wishing for market diversification will not make it so.  Own worst enemy  In the midst of the pandemic crisis, Australia can ill afford to be collateral damage in the strategic rivalry between the United States and China. Competition does not preclude co-operation. We need to find a way out of the diplomatic deep freeze with China. Quite clearly, Australia’s call for a global inquiry into COVID-19 has done little to thaw relations.  Beijing doesn’t make it easy. In the battle to win global hearts and minds, China is often its own worst enemy. Its clumsy exercise of soft power betrays a puzzling inability to gauge action and reaction in the West.  Witness China's threatened consumer boycott. If the ambassador’s intervention was intended to sway Australian sentiment in Beijing’s favour, it has likely achieved precisely the opposite effect.  China's COVID-19 response may well fall short of best practice, but as shown by Australia’s very own Ruby Princess debacle, few can boast a monopoly on best practice. Now is not the time for blame shifting and finger pointing.  None of these are bargaining chips to be traded in exchange for concessions.  Issues fuelling tension between Australia and China remain, including Huawei, foreign investment, foreign influence legislation, militarisation of the South China Sea, treatment of the Uyghurs in Xinjiang, and the detention of Dr Yang Hengjun.  None of these is a bargaining chip to be traded in exchange for concessions. Neither we nor China will ""bend the knee"" in return for improved relations.  In the wake of anti-Japanese riots erupting across China in 2012, President Xi Jinping and Prime Minister Shinzo Abe eventually found a way to rebuild ties without either side being seen to have ceded to the other. Delicate, diplomatic signals are key to enticing movement away from deeply entrenched positions. This is an example for Australia to follow.  Language matters. Beijing will have taken silent note of Australia’s decision to steer clear of the needlessly provocative “China Virus” taunts of the US Secretary of State. There is no advantage in joining a China “pile on”.  In a similar vein, the government is taking care to ensure changes to the foreign investment review framework are not framed as targeting Chinese investors. Guarding distressed assets against predatory investors presents a challenge, but buyer appetite will not be confined to China. The threat is global. Again, Beijing will be taking silent note.  Generosity of spirit was a favoured theme of former Westpac chief executive Gail Kelly. Now more than ever is a time for generous spirits to prevail. For example, rather than contrive a media frenzy around Chinese donations of allegedly defective medical equipment to nations across Europe, let’s focus on positives such as Jack Ma’s generous donation to the Doherty Institute.  Reservations about the methods used should not silence acknowledgment of China's apparent success in flattening the curve in Wuhan. We must counter the strident voices eager to frame COVID-19 in adversarial language of us versus them.  Words need to be balanced by actions. Australian business is hurting, and so too are Chinese companies struggling with export demand shock. Chinese companies will realise that, at least in part, their fate is tied to the success of the Morrison government’s measures to support Australian companies and their workers through to the other side of the pandemic crisis. Our economic fortunes are inextricably linked.  Business relationships  The Trade Minister, the Australia China Business Council and industry peak bodies have been admirably proactive in stressing the importance of companies maintaining business relationships through challenging times. Once lost, relationships of trust are notoriously difficult to recover.  More can be done. Appointment of a Special PRC Envoy would open a new channel of communication with Beijing. Australian business desires a diplomatic breakthrough that better positions Australia for the post-COVID-19 rebuild phase. Suitably eminent candidates might include John Howard, Kim Beazley, Ross Garnaut, Dennis Richardson or Nick Greiner.  Importantly, such an initiative would alert Australian business to the government’s willingness to inject fresh impetus into the relationship with China. So, too, would a decision for the Trade Minister or Special Envoy to lead a small but select delegation of business leaders to Beijing.  Of course, closed borders render such initiatives moot for the time being. But the COVID-19 crisis will eventually pass. Australia should be primed to launch at the earliest opportunity. In a post-pandemic world, we will be just one of many nations determined to rebuild bridges with Beijing.   Michael Clifton is the CEO of China Matters. He has served in a variety of defence and trade appointments across Asia, including six years leading the Austrade network across Greater China."	NotNews
COVID-19: UNIBEN researchers produce clinically tested ventilator  29 Apr 2020, 04:55 by The Eagle Online   Share on Facebook  Share on Twitter   RelatedPosts   20-year-old student produces manual ventilator for COVID-19 patients + video    UNIBEN VC, student beneficiaries commend Glo for providing ICT solutions    UNIBEN fixes date for post-UTME examinations   The Faculty of Engineering and Medical Sciences, University of Benin has produced a clinically tested ventilator to help sustain coronavirus patients in the state.

"How China is attempting to prevent a second wave of infections   29 Apr 2020, 05:29     Cyclists ride along a road as the sun sets in Beijing on April 23. With Chinese experts concluding that the virus cannot be eradicated, government officials are focused on keeping infections to a manageable level to avoid catastrophic surges that overwhelm hospitals. | BLOOMBERG   As the first major country to emerge from coronavirus lockdowns, China is focused on avoiding a devastating second wave of infections as it returns to a semblance of pre-pandemic life.  Distanced school desks, compulsory face masks and tracking apps are being deployed from the financial hub of Shanghai to the frigid northern province of Heilongjiang. With Chinese experts concluding that the virus cannot be eradicated, government officials are focused on keeping infections to a manageable level to avoid catastrophic surges that overwhelm hospitals.  This balancing act between letting people return to normal life while keeping infections at a low level is one that governments around the world, including the hardest-hit nations like Italy and the U.S., will have to try to master. Even with tools that others don’t have — powerful state surveillance and control of people’s movements — China doesn’t have a full picture, nor any guarantee of success.  ""All of which means that as China restarts its economic and social life, there are known unknowns that could viably lead to another outbreak,” said Nicholas Thomas, a professor specializing in public health at City University of Hong Kong.  Here are the strategies Chinese cities are trying:  Dealing with the border threat  Unfettered global travel will likely no longer be possible in a post-virus world as countries fear imported infections setting off new waves. Almost all foreign nationals are banned from entering China while citizens coming back from overseas have to spend at least two weeks in isolation.  The most strictly governed cities, like Beijing, are enforcing an additional seven days of home confinement after that. Anyone isolating at home in the capital city can trigger an alarm just by opening their front door while neighbors are encouraged to report people leaving their homes.  The extreme restrictions have gotten tighter even though there have been barely any new local cases in weeks, due in part to the political class that reside there.  ""Beijing is the capital, many government leaders live there and they have to consider the political impact and social stability concerns,” Huang Yanzhong, director of the Center for Global Health Studies at New Jersey’s Seton Hall University.  Other Chinese areas with the most draconian limits on travel include border provinces like Heilongjiang, which has seen a wave of infections from people crossing over its land border with Russia. It now requires 35 days of quarantine for such travelers, restricting import-export businesses in the region and pointing to a likely global future where economies dependent on border flows contract.  In financial hub Shanghai, hardly any restrictions are imposed on domestic travelers likely due to the need to remain open to investment and talent. A Bloomberg journalist traveling from Hubei province, where the outbreak began, to Shanghai didn’t encounter any particular restrictions, quarantine or even a requirement for testing once in the city.  Shanghai’s approach will likely be watched closely by authorities in other financial centers such as New York and Tokyo, cities whose dynamism depend on open domestic travel.  Mass testing  While many countries are still struggling to test everyone who appears sick, Chinese cities are now trying to pre-emptively test those returning to work.  In Hubei and Guangzhou provinces, companies are asking returning workers to take virus tests. In Shanghai, voluntary testing has been rolled out city-wide and companies and individuals can book tests at hospitals and clinics.  Clinics, infectious disease specialists and the local Center for Diseases Control are coordinated to identify, diagnose and isolate infections early, followed by swift contract tracing and quarantine to prevent community spread, according to Zhang Wenhong, the director of infectious diseases department at Shanghai Huashan Hospital.  ""In Shanghai there’s thousands of CDC people and doctors hunting down these patients and isolating their close contacts,” Zhang said. ""That’s critical for swift response in the prevention and control system.”  Tracking apps  In a move likely impossible in many democracies due to privacy concerns, China is combining the powers of its surveillance apparatus and its giant internet companies to keep tabs on who is vulnerable to infection.  Tracking and health monitoring functions built into smartphone apps from Alibaba Group Holding Ltd. and Tencent Holdings Ltd., China’s biggest companies, draw on data from government departments, phone carriers, locations and transactions to paint a detailed picture of each individual’s risk level.  The end result is that millions of people have to show their red, yellow or green color codes before being allowed into hotels, restaurants, shops, subways and residential compounds.  The codes are updated frequently and a green code — which gives freedom of movement — can be easily lost. Just visiting a shopping mall that an infected person also went to can mean one’s code changes to yellow, forcing mandatory home isolation.  Gradual reopening  While there has been an easing in restrictions, China has been careful to do so in stages. Many cities still don’t allow cinemas, theaters or bars to reopen, while the notorious traffic jams of Beijing and Shanghai have intensified as many shun the close confines of urban transit.  Face masks, already a common sight in China, have gone from optional precautions to mandatory in workplaces and public transport.  Heilongjiang province shows how quickly and unexpectedly new waves of infection can surge. A student who returned from the U.S. in March spent two weeks in quarantine and tested negative, and then likely still infected dozens others. Two hospitals had to be shut for disinfection, the city of Harbin delayed reopening schools and housing compounds were locked down.  The province also reported more than 370 imported infections since the beginning of April, mostly Chinese nationals who crossed the land border it shares with Russia.  Still, the patchy reopening hasn’t yet led to any significant national waves of new infection, giving hope to other countries as they start to plan to scale back their lockdowns.  ""Nobody wants to see another spike in cases by rushing the lifting of restrictions too soon,” said Takeshi Kasai, the World Health Organization regional director for the Western Pacific region at a briefing last week.  ""Individuals and society needs to be ready for a new way of living.”   PHOTOS     Cyclists ride along a road as the sun sets in Beijing on April 23.

A retail property apocalypse is unfolding - and it's going to be unpleasant  29 Apr 2020, 02:10 by Stephen Bartholomeusz  There is a lot of discussion about how the coronavirus pandemic might create new normals in behaviours and in industry landscapes. For property landlords, that combination could create very significant and quite unpleasant structural changes.  When Westpac announced its $1.6 billion of COVID-19-related provisioning this week, it specifically called out, not just a fall in residential property prices, but a decline in commercial property values.  The bank is more sensitive to developments in the commercial property sector than most, given that its triple exposure to those markets through the bank and its finance arms, AGC and Bill Acceptance Corporation, drove it to a $1.6 billion loss in 1992 – the biggest loss in Australian history to that time – and the brink of collapse.    A near-empty Chadstone shopping centre in Melbourne on March 20. It's commercial suicide to keep trading when there are no customers but it's creating headaches for landlords. Joe Armao   If there are to be problems within the commercial property sector, it isn’t hard to pinpoint the most stressed segments nor that much of a stretch to see them as something other than a temporary phenomenon.  Wesfarmers’ Rob Scott became the latest in a line of listed retail company chief executives to foreshadow large-scale store closures on Tuesday when he said he didn’t see many of the Target chain’s 290 large-format stores being commercially viable over time. Store numbers and sizes would be slashed; discussions with landlords would be held.  Veteran retailer Solomon Lew shut down Premier Investments' 1250 stores early on in the course of the pandemic and has suspended all lease payments. Premier, with about 70 per cent of its leases expiring this year, is inevitably going to put the screws to its landlords over future rents as part of a long-standing campaign to get them to share some of the pain the retail sector has experienced in recent years.  Premier isn’t the only large retailer to shut down and refuse to pay rent during the lockdown of the economy. It’s commercial suicide to continue to trade when there are no customers. The list of store closures is very, very long.  Inevitably, a lot of small discretionary retailers, restaurants, cafes, gyms and others won’t survive the lockdown despite the efforts of government to provide some life support.  If the larger chains and department stores do re-emerge as the economy starts to stir, they will have been badly wounded and have no choice but to rethink, far more aggressively and with far greater leverage over their landlords than pre-crisis, the nature of their physical networks.    Many of Target's 290 large format stores won't be viable and store numbers will be slashed. Discussions with landlords will be held. Tony Ashby   Online retail has been given a boost by the lockdown and consumer habits will change in ways that will accelerate the growth of online retail and other services as a result of their experiences during the quarantining and social distancing, although that’s not necessarily a panacea for retailers, given for them it is an immature, high-cost and low-margin channel.  The ravaging of discretionary retail will produce permanent, structural change and therefore the days when retail property could count on ever-increasing streams of rental income by leveraging the imbalance in their relationship with tenants are numbered. There will be a re-set of rentals and the income of the A-REITs exposed to the sector.  The other factor that will impact retail property is the abrupt halt to travel and immigration. The Morrison government had, before the pandemic, already reduced the cap on permanent immigration from 190,000 to 160,000. That’s now irrelevant. It’s going to be quite some time before we see immigrants, or overseas tourists, returning.  Given that immigration has been the driver of our population growth and underwritten the ever-increasing demand for commercial space, that has implications right across the property markets.     If retail is the epicentre of the tides of adverse influences on a market that has had nearly three decades of stability and growth and turned the A-REITs into something akin to blue-chip, yield-generating bonds, it isn’t the only sector where the experiences of the pandemic will generate permanent change.  In announcing its $807 million provision for the initial impacts it expects from COVID-19, National Australia Bank said more than 30,000 of its staff were working from home and that it would use the experience to consider the future nature of its workplaces. It could have added that a rethinking of the way its people work will impact the workspaces it needs.  Most other businesses are having similar experiences and realising that, with their people properly equipped (which generally means not much more than a laptop and secure access to the company’s systems) their businesses still function perfectly well. The much-maligned national broadband network has come into its own.  That has implications for the options companies will be able to give employees once the economy reopens and for their space requirements.     The pandemic has demonstrated that white-collar workplaces can be far more flexible and fluid than might have been thought and that digital communications is easier and more effective than might have been appreciated.  Offices will, of course, reopen once there is a green light to return to them. In the immediate aftermath of that return, however, social distancing and safe workplaces will still be front-of-mind and those issues are likely to persist from quite some time and perhaps permanently.  Commercial tenants might well require less space in future, particularly if forecasts of double-digit unemployment this year and next were to be borne out, but they will require safer spaces. There will be some costs associated with the redesigning of workplaces for a post-pandemic environment and tenants will be in a stronger position in future to insist that the landlords foot those bills.  On the other side of the pandemic, or at least the worst of it, it is obvious there will be fewer retailers, particularly small retailers and service providers, whether in suburban strips or the big malls.  Beyond the retail apocalypse, closed borders, a significant reduction in travel even once borders re-open, minimal population growth, changes to the way we work and the nature of the workplaces for those who do work in offices doesn’t auger well for other landlords or investors in any of those markets.

PCB hands 3-year ban to cricketer Umar Akmal   29 Apr 2020, 20:23   LAHORE — Pakistani Cricketer Umar Akmal was handed a three-year long ban by the Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) on Monday from all formats of the game after he pled guilty in failing to report the offer of fixing a match. Akmal who will turn 30 next month withdrew the challenge to the charges in March. The batsman has been suspended from Feb. 20 under the anti-corruption code, which states that if any player is approached to fix a game he/ she must report of the incident immediately. The decision was announced by the disciplinary committee after a brief hearing of the PCB which charged Akmal with 2 breaches. The board said, “The PCB referred the matter to the chairman of the disciplinary committee after determining that the batsman had not requested a hearing.” PCB’s Director of Anti-Corruption and Security Asif Mahmood said that authorities take no “pleasure in seeing a promising international cricketer being declared ineligible” and that too for a period of three years on corruption charges, but defended the ban as necessary. He added, “I request all professional cricketers to stay away from the menace of corruption and immediately inform relevant authorities as soon as they are approached.” After the sentence was delivered, Akmal was driven away by his driver as he avoided the media to comment on his ban. The 29-year-old batsman burst onto the cricket scene with a century in his debut Test match in 2009 against New Zealand, however, his career has been marred with disciplinary issues which have resulted in various fines and bans over the course of a checkered career. In 2014, Akmal was arrested after a scuffle with a traffic police officer, who allegedly stopped him for a traffic signal violation. So far Akmal has played 16 Tests, 121 One Day Internationals (ODIs) and 84 T20Is for Pakistan. The ban of Akmal is the latest in the series of match and/ or spot fixing punishments meted on to the Pakistani Cricket players. In 2000, Salim Malik who has been the skipper of Pakistani cricket team was banned for life and 6 more players including Waqar Younis and Wasim Akram were fined after a judicial inquiry on match fixing. — XploringIndia   related articles	News

"Twitter: Some Good News  29 Apr 2020, 20:33 by Akram's Razor  Summary   Twitter is a tempting trade into earnings with a huge relative valuation to peers flip last 30 days.  Return of sports catalyst may more than offset direct response weakness in ad model.  Long-term strategy concerns more in focus than ever before.answers remain elusive.   I’ve had some subscribers pinging me on whether I’m willing to change my mind on Twitter again and as is often the case with Twitter, it’s tempting. This is saying a lot considering I shorted the stock the day the Elliot deal was announced for the first time since 2015, and because my recent increased lockdown usage is a constant reminder of Twitter’s missed opportunities..  So what’s tempting about Twitter shares here?  Well, the short answer is relative valuation looks good again.     March 9 th EV/ 2019 REV  April 24 EV/2019 REV  2019 Rev Growth    Facebook  5.8x  6.8x  28%    Pinterest  6.4x  9x  51%    Twtr  6.5x  4.9x  13%    Snap  8.5x  12.7x  45%    On March 9 th , just a few days after recording a podcast discussing why Twitter was turning me off, I shorted the stock at roughly $34 on the Elliot deal news in the midst of what was then a free-falling market. This wasn’t an easy call considering how consistently long biased I’ve been on the name for the past several years. Choosing to throw in the towel on a long isn’t the same as flipping around and shorting, but that Monday I simply couldn’t resist. The short felt like a layup. Twitter, which for years had the saving grace of being the relatively undervalued online advertising social stock, was now sporting a premium EV/Sales to both Facebook and Pinterest. And they were committing to a large buyback to quiet down some activist investors which considering my experience with the stock all the way back to Salesforce’s failed bid, essentially felt like management conceding defeat. (TikTok surging with celebrities in a manner like Vine easily could have, Instagram which slipped through Twitter’s fingers for $500ml doing its thing, Quibi launching as essentially a Twitter Video+ of branded content, and Pinterest and Snapchat executing in their niches you don’t buy announce your first major buyback unless you are straight up out of ideas.) Thanks to the market chaos the trade returned a quick 30% which made exiting easy. That was six weeks ago…   Today   Today Twitter is trading at the lowest trailing EV/Sales multiple in the online ad universe which really is a crazy relative flip in such a short time span. There is also now a case to be made that Twitter has benefited from the virus as usage and engagement on the platform have likely outperformed peers.  Here is the week-by-week engagement data for Facebook, Instagram, and Twitter through April 4th from RivalIQ. Twitter’s engagement declines where roughly half what Facebook/Instagram went through on the way down.     But while engagement has held up well, there is also a compelling case to be made here that Twitter deserves its discount again because its ad platform is more leveraged to live events that have completely disappeared. (Comicon, March Madness, NBA FINALS, and the Olympics to name a few). So, getting excited about news/politics/finance engagement soaring when Twitter’s biggest issue has been its persistent monetization struggles relative to perceived reach in those verticals is a bit premature. Then add in the mobile application product (MAP) issues and the fact Twitter’s struggled when it comes to attracting direct response advertisers, and this peer discount starts to feel warranted. Mopub wasn’t growing and Twitter was in the process of rebuilding its ad server before the biggest online advertising disruption since the industry was created occurred. And for those not dialed into the sector, recent earnings calls are glaring reminder that Twitter’s direct response weakness is tough to ignore  Here is Snapchat managment discussing the current environment:   “We are seeing some bright spots amongst direct response advertisers, especially those who provide activities or products that our community can enjoy at home. In the short-term, we are shifting sales resources and pulling forward some investments in direct response to better serve the advertisers who are trying to reach our audience during this time.    Our deep investments in direct response advertising over the past few years, including advanced bidding and campaign management tools, ad formats designed specifically for mobile apps and ecommerce and backend performance optimization have positioned us well in this uncertain environment.”   And Google also called out this outperformance in direct response on their earnings call …   “In March, revenues began to decline and entered the month at a mid-teens percentage decline in year-on-year revenues, although, users’ search activity increased, their interest shifted to less commercial topics. In addition, there was also reduced spending by our advertisers.    YouTube advertising revenues were $4 billion, up 33% year-on-year. Significant YouTube revenue growth persisted until late in the first quarter with different performance trajectories for the brand and direct response components. Direct response continued to have substantial year-on-year growth throughout the entire quarter. Brand advertising growth accelerated in the first 2 months of the quarter, but began to experience a headwind in mid-March. As a result by the end of March, total YouTube ads revenue growth had decelerated to a year-on-year growth rate in the high-single-digit.”   This direct response chink in the Twitter ad armor does kind of dampen the bull case. Online ad peers like Snapchat can point to captive millenials and the fact that video game publishers and media companies need to come to them. Pinterest can talk cooking and home improvement monetization in consumer products. TikTok can talk pure feel good entertainment and musicians/celebrities engaging with fans in a manner that essentially replaces live events. That’s a lot more compelling ad story than Twitter’s derivatives of virus news/politics content. So why am I saying the stock is a tempting long?  Well, because the service does suck you in so well, and thus the long-term yet to be achieved potential of it is always there whispering in your ear. Also, in this inflate the entire stock market to prevent armageddon FED tape, Twitter looks relatively cheap. Basically, if Uber without a CTO and CFO and with gross bookings cliff diving is flat on the year, Twitter at less than 5x sales and sub 20x EBITDA with a nice data licensing biz cushion still there is almost a deep value stock with low expectations . Also, Twitter still has an event catalyst element the others are missing, SPORTS. In whatever form professional sports resume, Twitter is set up to see a unique rebound from pent up consumer demand. So, for the trader junkies out there, which these days is pretty much everyone with an internet connection on the planet, Twitter stock is calling!  However, for sensible investors with a holding horizon that extends beyond monetary induced euphoria and corona investing summer camp trades, serious long-term questions remain. Just spend some time on Twitter and you will quickly be reminded of why being long the stock is such torture.   Some Bad News   I’ll start with this tweet...     This was how Jon Krasinski launched his new hit Youtube show Some Good News.  He opened the 1 st episode of the show with these words:  ""For years now, I've been wondering, why is there not a news show dedicated entirely to good news? Well, desperately seeking my fix somewhere else, I reached out to all of you this week, asking — nay, begging — for some good news…..after reading those replies and the incredibly heartwarming stories that came with them, I thought, 'All right. Enough is enough, world. Why not us?” Why not now?'”  Now does anyone remember Jack Dorsey asking Elon Musk how to fix Twitter just 3 months ago?  The same Elon who Tweeted this….     Ok, there is no denying Elon brings attention to Twitter, but what brand wants to be associated with that type of content??  John Krasinski is making it look so easy. Within days of launching Some Good News Krasinski had a line of major brands (30+according to my sources) out the door asking to work with him. Yet here is Twitter struggling with content health and monetization and the type of fix it’s looking for is literally staring it in the face. Like Jon basically launched a late-night show on par with the best in the biz with some crayons, a camera, and his Twitter feed/followers, and yet the show is housed on Youtube?  Maybe Mr. Dorsey should ask Jon how to fix Twitter or better yet make him the head of feel good content.  And let’s be clear Twitter’s problems don’t just stop there. A few days after Some Good News aired its first episode Quibi launched...   Quibi   Now some of you might be wondering what’s the compare here as Quibi is a streaming platform typically perceived to be competing against the likes of Netflix and Amazon, but to me Quibi is the type of interesting experiment Twitter should have already mastered. It’s professionally produced content in bite size (10mn) portions that is tailored to mobile. And to be honest it’s got some fun shows like Flipped and Dishmantled that one could actually envision working for a Cable esque Twitter subscription product.  Because really these days what is Twitter other than cable news & radios less profitable cousin?  When I stop and think of all the content I’m consuming off Twitter that is tied to people whose brands I associate with Twitter it’s just remarkable. Whether I’m listening to Kara Swisher interview Adam Grant and Niall Ferguson, Professor Galloway rant about education, Howard Lindzon interview Chris Sacca, QTR dishing with Carson Block, Josh Brown ranting on markets, or watching some Real Vision; the path always leads back to Twitter. The platform continues to be a free public relations firm for content creators who are clever enough to use it to build their brands and then go monetize/grow elsewhere. Which is why at this point I do wonder why Twitter has not swung away in a Howard Stern/Siri us fashion and just launched a premium subscription service with a dozen or so homegrown anchors across its major verticals.   Competitive Threats Are Growing   Consider that the New York Times just announced that Kara Swisher’s Recode/Decode award winning Podcast will essentially be moving to their new Opinion Audio product. Now do the math on how much time Kara spends on Twitter and her engagement with her audience, and what that translates into in terms of hours a week of undivided podcast attention for potential advertisers let alone a premium subscription product. Then factor in that Twitter has more cash on hand than the NYT’s current market cap. Did Twitter even take a crack here? And why is Josh Brown even appearing on CNBC anymore vs having his own exclusive Twitter financial markets show? Mr. Dorsey really should be thinking like Nike and locking down a stable of top Twitter contributors in the finance/politics/journalism game. Or maybe take a crack at Howard Stern with his deal up at the end of the year or some Fox News personalities, but please do something cause the clock is ticking.   Podcasting Is Heating Up   Also, the NYT bringing Kara Swisher on board shows how serious traditional media is getting about audio, and they have a good reason for it. Their podcast The Daily is a huge hit that is regularly generating more than 2 million downloads and over $1 million a month in revenue. They also recently acquired Audm, which is basically the Audible of journalistic content. But the New York Times is not alone with respect to making this push into the Podcast space. Spotify just spent $200 million on Bill Simmons The Ringer podcast network. This follows other Spotify podcast network acquisitions like Gimlet Media and Parcast as well as the podcast creation app Anchor. As podcasting targeting tools improve the ad dollar threat for Twitter gets very real. Spotify now has nearly 60 million users listening to the 700k+ podcasts available on its platform. This is usage is up 200% yr/yr, and this is in a world where Sirius XM still has 35ml subscribers generating roughly $5.6bl in annual subscription revenue. So, maybe there are better things for Twitter to do than buyback stock equal to 10% of their market cap here.   Does Twitter Management Get All This?   It would be incredibly arrogant to argue Twitter management doesn’t get a lot of these things. They have signed plenty of notable content deal s across sports, music, gaming, finance, politics, and entertainment since 2017. But without a premium on demand format to consume this content or a focus on standout Twitter home grown personalities I think it’s fair at this point to ask whether this strategy has really worked?  Or maybe Twitter management is just unlucky …  How else do you explain the fact that Mr. Dorsey was an angel investor in Instagram and that Twitter offered $500ml for the company in 2012 before Zuck swooped in and got it for $1bl. Or that a few months later they went out and bought Vine for $30m which soared to 200ml users and then quickly flamed out. Only for today to see TikTok quickly turn into the dream user generated social video success Vine should have been?  And the bad luck with respect to Twitter doesn’t just apply to content/acquisition failures….  Remember when the platform was going to change real-time disaster response ?     It’s kind of difficult to ignore the untapped global utility crisis containment potential that was to be Twitter in the midst of a global pandemic.  Yep, there was once a dream that was Twitter. You could only whisper it. Anything more than a whisper and it would vanish...  (This article was published 2 weeks ago to subscribers of Akram's Razor .)  Disclosure: I am/we are long FB.

‘New normal’ dawns after COVID-19 lockdown disrupts life  29 Apr 2020, 20:49 by David Mukholi   Since the outbreak of the coronavirus, the world is beginning to discover that life can be lived differently.        Ugandan bureaucrats and legislators often travelled abroad on benchmarking missions in response to national problems. Flying business class with hefty allowances they claimed it was for the good of the country or more appealing but a burden on the taxpayer. But they have not responded to the coronavirus with benchmarking or fact-finding trips. No bureaucrat or MP has proposed one.  Instead, Parliament’s committee on health is doing the right thing checking health facilities’ preparedness to handle COVID-19 cases. Not only has the coronavirus wiped out the appetite to travel abroad due to the risk of catching it but also crippled movements thanks to a lockdown aimed at containing the virus. It is the dawn of a new normal. Since the outbreak of the coronavirus, the world is beginning to discover that life can be lived differently, for instance, businesses can be conducted without having to travel. Technology is presenting what is to become normal after the coronavirus pandemic. Last month, G-20 countries didn’t have to travel to Saudi Arabia, which holds the rotating presidency; their summit was conducted online via video conferencing. Presidents of the East Africa Community countries are also expected to use the same technology. In future, travel for meetings will become an option as video conferencing is cheaper and convenient. Its use is likely to grow so is working from home using similar technology. The lockdown across the world has disrupted ways of life that had become normal and created what is being referred to as the new normal. Already some parts of the world contemplating opening up are beginning to talk about the new normal, which will include less travelling. This will severely affect the travel and tourism business, which includes airlines and hotels. The new normal will raise the sense of home as the people living in the diaspora think more about their places of origin. The spread of the virus and the lockdown compelled people working abroad to call on their governments for help to return them home. The new normal will have people thinking about their countries differently. In 2017, Ugandans working abroad snubbed and ridiculed a foreign affairs ministry note requesting them to register. Hardly any responded but now faced with the coronavirus they are registering so as to be evacuated, marking the beginning of the new normal. Now that they have realised the value of the Government knowing where they live and work, in future they will register. It is different for the illegals living under the radar. Nevertheless, these will improve their own networks for registration without compromising their concealed existence. Ugandans abroad now appreciate that home is best and will not live abroad rootless. The cries to get back to Uganda have been loud, simply because they want to get back home where if they contract COVID-19 their families will there to provide care. Attitudes about registration in Uganda will also change. It will not be as uphill a task as it was with the registration for national identity cards. Sometimes threats had to be employed to get people to oblige. Now, the ID is essential; without it no relief food. Past efforts to register bodabodas failed, yet the riders are among those described as the hand-to-mouth earners affected most by the lockdown. As a result, efforts by the Government to reach them for assistance have been difficult and dogged the distribution of food. Nearly all the hand-to-mouth, those who subsist on daily meagre income from the informal sector, are not known. There is no record of them even at LC offices as expected, which has been the norm. This will change after the lockdown with the people willing to be registered just to guard against any emergency in future. It also follows that even if they live off their daily income, these people will in future plan for emergencies. Ironically the bulk of them fund the entertainment industry. From the little they earn they save to attend music concerts and go to the pubs, meaning that the propensity to save exists but spending priorities are wrong. A lot will change. During the lockdown parents who were hardly at home are discovering the value of family time. In the past many stayed away for long hours, delegating domestic responsibilities to the maids. But following nearly two months of the staying home some time will be set aside for the family in future. There are countless stories of children who have never seen their parents together in the house because of busy schedules and social commitments. Now the lockdown has put their parents in the same space and time with them. Staying home is also making people realise and appreciate their freedoms and rights better. At home they are like prisoners; can’t walk, work and go for parties, etc. Now they know they had freedom and rights before the lockdown. Life will not be the same.

Radio station steps up fight against coronavirus  AIR Kothagudem broadcasting jingles on protective measures  29 Apr 2020, 18:00 by P SridharBHADRADRI-KOTHAGUDEM  The Kothagudem-based All India Radio (AIR) station is spearheading a mass media campaign by broadcasting jingles on social distancing, hand hygiene and other protective measures against coronavirus.  The FM radio station in the coal town is supplementing the district administration’s efforts in reaching out to people living in far-flung tribal pockets and the vast coal belt region to enlist their support.  As part of the campaign, Kothagudem radio station aired the speech of Collector M V Reddy thrice in the last one month. The 30-minute speech based on a telephone interview by the AIR staff concerned provides an insight into the concerted efforts by the administration to stave off spread of coronavirus in the predominantly tribal-populated district.  No new cases  All the four COVID-19 positive cases reported in the district last month turned negative and no new cases have been reported from anywhere so far this month, sources said.  “We are broadcasting programmes based on excerpts from Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s speech on ‘Saptapadi’ (seven points to tackle the coronavirus threat) and also the Collector’s speech highlighting wide ranging interventions to effectively deal with the COVID-19 threat,” said A. Srihari, Programme Officer, AIR, Kothagudem.  Small and catchy jingles in Telugu are being played at regular intervals to highlight the imperative need to strictly adhere to social distancing and lockdown norms besides maintaining hand hygiene to keep the coronavirus at bay, he noted.  “We are receiving positive feedback from regular listeners comprising visually challenged persons who are pledging their support to the collective battle against COVID-19,” he remarked.

Alphabet Earnings Gives the Market a Raise  Alphabet blew past earnings estimates, sending the whole market higher overnight   29 Apr 2020, 18:37   Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOG , NASDAQ: GOOGL ), the artists formerly known as Google, reported earnings April 28 that sent the market into raptures.     Source: turtix / Shutterstock.com    Net income of $6.84 billion, $9.87 per share, on revenue of $41.16 billion, gave traders hope the worst of the pandemic is over. This, despite most of the money coming in before the national lockdown in March.  Traders sent shares up nearly $95 each during the evening. They floated down the next morning but were still up over 7% as trading began April 29.  The Alphabet Bump  GOOG stock shares rose only 3% on the earnings release, but rose another 6% during the company’s earnings call. Admitting that March revenues dropped off a cliff, CFO Ruth Porat said things didn’t get any worse in April. She said consumer “engagement” with the company’s services remained high.  In addition to the main search engine, Google got a big bump from its Google Play store, which serves Android devices. App downloads were up 30% in March, and there are now 2.5 billion Google Play accounts. Future growth can be expected from Google Meet, a video conference service that competes with Zoom Video Communications (NASDAQ: ZM ). CEO Sundar Pichai said Meet is adding “millions of users per day.” And Meet is free.  “We’re seeing some early signs at this point that users are returning to more commercial behavior,” Porat concluded. This sent the whole market off to the races. The NASDAQ was up 1.08% by early morning, and the S&P Futures rose .9% to nearly 2,900.  Those numbers might decline after the first quarter GDP report, due at 8:30 a.m. on April 29. But that could spur yet another rise in Alphabet shares, based on the company’s relative strength.  It’s Not All Great for GOOG Stock  Not all the news was stellar. Revenue from “other bets,” start-ups like its Verily health, Loon balloon Internet and Wing drone businesses, fell to $135 million from $170 million.  Google seems more dependent on Web advertising than ever, and those cash flows remain under threat. The government of Australia is demanding it share revenue with its struggling news companies. France has done the same. The European Union keeps hitting it with billion-dollar fines over the business model.  Google has responded in the past by dropping news snippets from search results. When governments demand payment for links Google just doesn’t link, blinding the global audience to the content. This controversy could come to the U.S., where news outlets are going completely out of business.  YouTube advertising grew 25% but that may under-rate the unit’s success. Its subscription revenue, a paid streaming service called YouTube Premium, was put under a category called “Google Other,” whose revenue was up 20% to $4.4 billion.  Google Cloud revenues were up by one-third, but off a small base. Total revenue for the unit was $2.77 billion, and it has yet to gain market share against rivals Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT ) and Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN ), with China’s Alibaba Group Holding (NASDAQ: BABA ) gaining on it.  The Bottom Line on GOOG Stock  Analysts had been expecting much worse news. Alphabet’s rise from the March lows has trailed that of the other Cloud Czars. Chart analysts focused on April’s high of $1,294 as a key figure , but results sent GOOG stock well past that.  Even with its first quarter beat, Google stock still has room to rise. The shares were trading at over $1,500 in February. The price to earnings ratio remains in the mid-20s, against nearly 30 for Microsoft. Take out the $117 billion in cash and the company’s worth $730 billion, with operating cash flow on pace to top $45 billion.  In a world where great companies are falling apart, that seems like performance worth its premium. If GOOG stock had even a small dividend it would blow past the February high of $1,536.

"Shamrock Rovers announce support of FAI's plan for return to football behind closed doors  29 Apr 2020, 18:41 by Daniel McDonnell Twitter Email  Shamrock Rovers have backed the FAI's attempts to prepare for the prospect of closed doors football.  The Hoops have released a statement endorsing the idea of giving the concept the opportunity to work.  They acknowledge that football may not return to full normality within the next 18 months and therefore feel now is the right moment to look at the prospect of closed doors games and streaming options - even if there is no certainty about whether or when public health officials would give it the green light.  In a statement, Rovers said: ""Unlike many European leagues and the English Premier League, the League of Ireland got as far as game 5 when the closedown commenced.   For all the latest sports news, analysis and updates direct to your inbox, sign up to our newsletter .   ""Many other leagues are at the final stages of their competitions and some have taken the decision to cease at this point.  ""We are in a different situation and need the return to football in 2020 to continue with our domestic season in addition to being prepared to play in the 2020/2021 UEFA competitions when they commence later this year.  ""We know that ""normal"" is not coming to society in general for quite some time, perhaps up to 18 months from now, so we need to adapt to these times and playing with reduced crowds or no crowds and streaming the games is a positive for the game.    Stephen Bradley. Photo: Sportsfile   ""We will collaborate with all clubs and, through the NLEC (National League Executive Committee), we look forward to developing the ‘behind closed doors’ opportunity with Niall Quinn, Gary Owens and all staff members involved at the FAI.""  Rovers boss Stephen Bradley said: ""I welcome the work done by the clubs, PFAI and the FAI in putting together a comprehensive set of guidelines from the resumption of training to matchdays that will allow our league recommence whenever it is safe to do so.  ""Football is not just a game, this is the occupation of our squad and like everyone else, we are keen to return to work and we will be ready to participate fully with all health and safety guidelines and instructions.""

"Woman, 45, weeps as she is jailed for seven years after being caught hiding a loaded sawn-off shotgun and £16,000 worth of cocaine in her loft for drugs gang  29 Apr 2020, 18:02 by Georgia Simcox For Mailonline    Amanda Morrison, 45, was pressured by gangsters to hide shotgun in her loft    Police raided her flat in Ashton-under-Lyne, Greater Manchester, last year    Morrison confessed to detectives the gun had been in her attic for a year    A woman wept as she was jailed for seven and a half years after being caught hiding a loaded sawn-off shotgun and £16,000 worth of cocaine in her loft for a drugs gang.  Amanda Morrison, 45, was pressured by gangsters to hide the shortened BSA Snipe single barrelled gun in her loft after she got caught up in a drugs racket.  She was ordered to store the gun as well as 14 rounds of ammunition after the hoodlums befriended her through her partner and gave her crack cocaine.  Police raided her flat in Ashton-under-Lyne, Greater Manchester, following a tip off that drugs were being stored and distributed from the property.    Amanda Morrison, 45, was pressured by gangsters to hide the shortened BSA Snipe single barrelled gun in her loft after she got caught up in a drugs racket   Morrison confessed to detectives that the gun had been in her attic for a year and officers discovered it wrapped heavily in plastic.  Cocaine worth £16,000 and with a purity of 78 per cent was also seized in the bust along with weighing scales and an addicts's 'debtors list'.  She was arrested alongside two men. Charges were dropped against one and the other suspect was ordered to face trial on other matters.  Morrison, who is originally from Scoutstoun, Glasgow, initially pleaded to be spared a mandatory minimum five-year jail term imposed for firearms offences.  She pleaded 'exceptional circumstances' but her DNA was found on the trigger of the gun and the cartridge cases.  She claimed the gun belonged to one of the arrested men.  At Minshull Street Crown Court, Manchester, Morrison, who had no previous convictions, broke down in tears as she was given five and a half years jail for possessing a prohibited weapon.  She was given a further two years for possessing Class A drugs with intent to supply to run consecutively. She pleaded guilty to both offences.  Sentencing Judge Tina Landale said: 'You have endured a difficult life which has been dominated by very serious abuse by men and the effect of that abuse likely made you far less able to resist pressure by those who brought these items into your home.  'You were used by them - no doubt you were an easy target for them.  'But you were the custodian of a lethal, modified and fearsome weapon with ammunition.  'The gun had been in your possession in your loft for a considerable period of time although I take into account the full admissions you have made which some may describe as ""brave"" and the fact the gun was not for your own use.    Cocaine worth £16,000 and with a purity of 78 per cent was also seized in the bust along with weighing scales and an addicts's 'debtors list'   'You were holding the gun for another person and it is clear that it had no lawful purpose whatsoever and is capable of inflicting death to more than one person.  'You played an important and significant role in the drugs trade of cocaine and although the profit was not for you, you were keeping those drugs at home for others who would profit out of this miserable trade - a trade you will be well aware of because you are a victim of it.'  The court heard the 8am raid took place on May 1 last year when officers executed a drugs warrant.  Robert Elias prosecuting said: 'Morrison said there was a shotgun in her attic, a search took place and a heavily wrapped up package was discovered which contained a gun with 14 shotgun cartridges.  'Serial numbers on the gun had been partially removed and it was a fearsome weapon which had been shortened to make it even more deadly if used indoors.  'At the flat Morrison told officers: ""It’s been up there for a year and I’m going to get battered for saying that - but I don’t know anything more about it."" However subsequent analysis of the gun found a DNA profile from Morrison on the trigger and on the cartridge cases.'  Snap bags containing 200 grams of cocaine which was waiting to be cut ahead of being sold were seized along with mobile phones, three sets of electronic scales and a debtors list.  Morrison later made no comment in interview.    At Minshull Street Crown Court, Manchester, Morrison, who had no previous convictions, broke down in tears as she was given seven and a half years jail   In mitigation defence counsel Miss Katherine Pierpoint said: 'She has never been before the court before and is of previous good character. Miss Morrison through an ex-partner became friends with a number of men who clearly were not friends of hers. She began to use drugs and found herself in debt to these men and as a result of that, pressure was put on her to store drugs at her address.  'She was involved on occasion in in bagging up the drugs but her benefit was not cash but drugs for herself. She was extremely open about how long this had been going on. She didn’t try and make things up and suggest these items were in the property for a short length of time.  'This is somebody who because of her drug use has been used by others and very sadly those who are involved in serious crime have access to firearms and that is how this gun was put in her loft.  'Like many women in her situation she has been used by others, mainly men over the entirety of her life. She had a difficult upbringing and was involved in a number of violent relationships.  'She is not somebody who is linked to serious and organised crime. Others took advantage of the fact she has her own addiction and problems. She wants to return to her native Scotland where she will be able to live with her mother and never come before these courts again. She has shown a level of insight and remorse for what she has got herself involved in.'   RELATED ARTICLES"	News
"Ex-NAACP leader Kweisi Mfume wins Maryland seat in Congress  29 Apr 2020, 11:01 by Associated Press    Democrat Kweisi Mfume removes a face mask before addressing reporters during an election night news conference after he won the 7th Congressional District special election, Tuesday, April 28, 2020, in Baltimore. Mfume defeated Republican Kimberly Klacik to finish the term of the late Rep. Elijah Cummings, retaking a Maryland congressional seat Mfume held for five terms before leaving to lead the NAACP. All voters in the 7th Congressional District were strongly urged to vote by mail in an unprecedented election dramatically reshaped by the coronavirus pandemic. (AP Photo/Julio Cortez)   BALTIMORE (AP) — Democrat Kweisi Mfume easily won a mostly mail-in election to finish the term of the late Elijah Cummings, retaking a Maryland congressional seat he held for five terms before leaving to lead the NAACP.  Mfume defeated Republican Kimberly Klacik in the heavily Democratic 7th Congressional District, capping a race dramatically reshaped by the coronavirus pandemic. Taking off his mask for a brief victory speech Tuesday night, he acknowledged the many people ""struggling at this hour to fight off the terrible disease of the coronavirus.”  “To them, to their families and to the families of so many others who have lost lives prematurely to this disease, I want all of you to know that from day one, all of my attention, all of my energy and all of my focus in the United States Congress will be on using science, data and common sense to help get our nation through this dark hour in our history,” Mfume said.  Mfume was flanked by his wife and a few other supporters who also wore masks as protection against the virus.  In what could be a test for future races this election year, Maryland opened just three polling stations Tuesday and sent ballots weeks in advance to encourage mail voting to reduce public health risks, hoping to avoid what happened earlier this month in Wisconsin, where thousands of primary voters waited for hours outside overcrowded polling stations.  For Mfume, the immediate challenge will be leading in a majority-black district with a sizable area in Baltimore that for weeks had Maryland's highest number of reported coronavirus cases. Democratic lawmakers have sounded the alarm over the virus killing African Americans at a higher rate.  Democrats outnumber Republicans by more than 4-1 in the district, which includes a significant portion of the city of Baltimore and parts of Baltimore and Howard counties. The diverse district includes areas of Baltimore that struggle with poverty and violent crime, and more affluent areas and such landmarks as Johns Hopkins Hospital.  The 71-year-old Mfume also spoke Tuesday evening of tackling challenges that include food deserts in poor urban areas, a lack of transportation and the need to modernize school buildings. He said people are crying out for change.  “I promise you that as your congressman I will use every ability that I have to bring about that change,” Mfume said after capturing an overwhelming number of votes in the city and strong majorities in both counties.  Mfume also supports stronger gun-control measures, including reauthorizing a federal assault weapons ban that expired in 2005. Baltimore had 348 homicides last year — the fifth straight year topping 300 — making it the city’s most violent year ever per capita.  Mfume is to serve the rest of Cummings’ term until January. Victory also means Mfume will run as an incumbent in Maryland’s June primary to be the nominee for a full term in November.  Mfume held the seat for five terms from 1987 to 1996 and chaired the NAACP from 1996 until 2004. The NAACP is based in Baltimore.  The 7th district attracted national attention last year when President Donald Trump referred to it on Twitter as a “disgusting, rat and rodent infested mess” where “no human being would want to live.” At the time, Cummings was the powerful House Oversight Committee chairman, leading multiple investigations of the president.  Trump’s tweets also followed an appearance by Klacik on the Fox News network’s program “Fox & Friends,” which invited her on air to discuss her social media posts showing trash in Baltimore. Klacik, a Baltimore County Republican Central Committee member, had campaigned on economic development and helping struggling parts of Baltimore via a federal “opportunity zones” program.  After Mfume seized early victory, Klacik tweeted: “That one time when hard work didn’t pay off. Perhaps one day District 7 will want a change. Proud of my team & the work we put in.”  In the June 2 primary, Mfume will face many of the same opponents he defeated in February. The primary was originally scheduled for April but was postponed by Gov. Larry Hogan due to the virus.  ___  Witte reported from Annapolis, Maryland.

"Iran says reopened for business as no end in sight to virus crisis  29 Apr 2020, 11:23 by AFP  Tehran (AFP) - Iran reopened for business despite its persistent coronavirus outbreak as there was no end in sight to the crisis, its president said Wednesday, as 80 new deaths were announced.  ""Due to uncertainty about when this virus will end, we are preparing for work, activity and science,"" said President Hassan Rouhani.  ""We have to follow all the medical instructions, but work and production are as essential as these precautions,"" he told a televised cabinet meeting.  His remarks came as the health ministry announced that 80 new deaths from the novel coronavirus had taken the country's overall toll to 5,957.  Ministry spokesman Kianoush Jahanpour said another 1,073 people tested positive for the virus in the past 24 hours.  All but 20,000 of the 93,657 people who contracted the illness since mid-February have been discharged from hospital, he told a televised news conference.  Iran has struggled to contain the coronavirus outbreak since reporting its first cases -- two deaths in the Shiite holy city of Qom -- on February 19.  The actual numbers of those killed and sickened by the virus are widely thought to be much higher than the Iranian government's official tolls.  Despite still battling the virus, the government has allowed many businesses to reopen since April 11 after shutting most down in mid-March to stem the spread of the disease."	News
"Australia to ramp up coronavirus testing with millions of new kits  29 Apr 2020, 11:22 by Colin Packham  Australia has secured 10 million COVID-19 test kits, Health Minister Greg Hunt said on Wednesday, as Canberra begins widespread testing that it hopes will sustain a decline in new coronavirus cases and allow social restrictions to be lifted.  Australia - home to 25.7 million people - has confirmed about 6,700 cases of the novel coronavirus and just 88 deaths, way below figures reported in the United States and other hotspots, a result the government attributes to social distancing restrictions and testing.  Authorities plan to expand testing this week to include people who do not show symptoms, a move the government says is vital to allow the easing of restrictions and the reopening of parts of the economy shut down by the outbreak.  “Testing is necessary to detect and control outbreaks, if physical distancing measures are to be relaxed,” Chief Medical Officer Brendan Murphy said in an emailed statement.  The kits were secured from China by Fortescue Metals Group founder Andrew Forrest.  Victoria state said it would open mobile units that can test people in their homes, offices and while out shopping. New South Wales state Premier Gladys Berejiklian urged care workers and anyone with the ""slightest sniffle"" to get tested.  With new infections growing at barely 1% a day, compared to 25% a month ago, several states are already beginning to ease restrictions including at Sydney's famous Bondi Beach.

Google Chromecast Ultra 2 Could Be on the Cards Along With a New Remote  29 Apr 2020, 11:30 by Shabana Arif  A listing has been spotted on Taiwanese certification agency NCC's website for a new Google Chromecast Ultra device and a remote to go along with it, which is good news for those of you who have been waiting for an update and wishing for a remote.  MySmartPrice shared the documents that mention a dongle and remote control, and appears to be the second-generation Chromecast Ultra. The device missed out on a refresh when the Google Chromecast got a third iteration back in 2018, so it's due for an upgrade. And that upgrade appears to be the addition of the remote.     Rumours about a new Chromecast Ultra have been floating about since last month, with 9to5Google reporting that while the hardware for the streaming device (codenamed Sabrina) will remain largely unchanged, it'll support 4K HDR content and will include WiFi and Bluetooth connectivity. Meanwhile, the remote will feature a microphone and Google Assistant button for voice control, and will apparently be programmable to your telly.  We'd expect any new products to be unveiled at Google I/O in May, but the event went from being turned into an online event, to just being cancelled outright . Google might still go ahead with a May launch regardless, which is right around the corner, so there isn't long to wait (hopefully) for some kind of update. [ Pocket-lint ]	News
"LAB SCANDAL  Wuhan lab blamed for coronavirus LIED about safety precautions it took during controversial bat tests  29 Apr 2020, 16:32 by Stephen Moyes   THE laboratory at the heart of the world’s coronavirus pandemic lied about taking safety precautions when collecting bat samples, The Sun can exclusively reveal.   Shocking leaked photos - which reveal a scandalous lack of safety - were deleted from the website of under-fire China science hub the Wuhan Institute of Virology.  ⚠️ Read our < a coronavirus live blog for the latest news & updates    The Sun can reveal a page of the institute’s website - deleted suddenly last month - shows no such safety precautions were employed     Intelligence sources in the US and UK are 'monitoring the deleted photos with great interest'   US and British intelligence officials suspect bungling scientists at the Wuhan Institute of Virology accidentally spread the killer disease during risky coronavirus tests on bats.  It was claimed that Covid-19 was ""developed in the Wuhan lab as China hoped to prove it's greater than the US at battling deadly diseases"".  The Sun can reveal a page of the Wuhan institute’s website - deleted suddenly last month - shows no safety precautions were employed.  One worker admitted being sprayed with bat blood or urine as images showed staff brazenly collecting samples with no face masks or protective suits.  SPRAYED WITH BAT BLOOD  Incredibly some scientists didn’t even wear gloves as they entered caves to collect fecal bat swab samples, beaming for the camera and oblivious to the dangers.  The damning photos tell a different story to an official 2017 journal, when the institute insisted: ""Bat samplings were conducted ten times from April 2011 to October 2015 at different seasons in their natural habitat at a single location (cave) in Kunming, Yunnan Province, China.  “All members of field teams wore appropriate personal protective equipment, including N95 masks, tear-resistant gloves, disposable outerwear, and safety glasses.  “Bats were trapped and fecal swab samples were collected as described previously.”  One of the party even gave an interview to state-run news agency Xinhua, admitting he forgot his protective gear and was sprayed with bat urine or blood.  Intelligence sources in the US and UK were “monitoring the deleted photos with great interest”, The Sun was told last night.    US and British intelligence officials suspect bungling scientists at the Wuhan Institute of Virology accidentally spread the killer disease during risky coronavirus tests on bats   Matthew Henderson, director of the Asia Studies Centre at the Henry Jackson Society, and a former British diplomat in China, told The Sun: ""China has still not clearly explained how the outbreak started, without it we are obliged to draw our own conclusions.  “There is ample evidence of such a cavalier approach to biosecurity by Chinese scientists based in Wuhan laboratories that it is no surprise that western Governments are now seriously considering whether COVID-19 could have escaped from one.""  Earlier this month photos from the same Wuhan lab showed a broken seal on a store containing 1,500 virus strains - including the bat coronavirus linked to the devastating pandemic.  The images were published by the state-owned China Daily before they too were swiftly deleted.  A picture of the fridge-freezer revealed a flimsy loose seal on the door, as a lab worker pulled out a chilled box containing deadly samples while wearing gloves and a mask.  Several insiders claimed the deadly bug wasn't manufactured as a bioweapon but to prove China was on par with - or superior to - the US, in its ability to fight infections.  “Patient zero"" was a laboratory worker at the Wuhan lab who spread the virus into the community, sources said.    Some scientists didn’t even wear gloves as they entered caves to collect fecal bat swab samples, beaming for the camera and oblivious to the dangers     US officials warned two years ago that safety lapses during the study of bats could lead to a coronavirus outbreak   When US President Donald Trump was asked about the extraordinary claims, he said: ""More and more we’re hearing the story.  ""And we'll see. We are doing a very thorough examination of this horrible situation that happened.""  Blaming the Wuhan meat market - where bats are not sold - was reportedly an effort to deflect blame from the communist government when the lab's containment efforts failed.  US officials warned two years ago that safety lapses during the study of bats could lead to a coronavirus outbreak.  Secret cables from American embassy officials were obtained following their 2018 visits to the Wuhan lab now at the centre of a global focus.  The missives revealed fears of inadequate safety precautions by those conducting the bat studies could result in a deadly new strain of coronavirus.  One US official said: “The cable was a warning shot. They were begging people to pay attention to what was going on.”  The cables reveal that the US Embassy in Beijing took the unusual step of repeatedly sending science diplomats to the Wuhan Institute of Virology.  In 2015, the lab had become China’s first to achieve the highest level of international bioresearch safety.  But the cables argued that the US should give the Wuhan lab further support – because its research on bat coronaviruses was important but dangerous.  In 2017 the institute published research showing that horseshoe bats they collected from a cave in Yunnan province were very likely from the same population that spawned the 2003 SARS virus.  The Chinese government has put a total lockdown on information related to the virus origins.  Beijing has yet to provide samples of the coronavirus collected from the earliest cases.  Officials at the Wuhan lab have dismissed allegations coronavirus came from their facility, branding them ‘baseless conspiracy theories’.  But genetic evidence indicates the virus was not artificially engineered and likely originated in bats.  The genetic data cannot yet indicate exactly where and how the virus first crossed to humans.  China President Xi Jinping warned the public about the virus on January 20 - when more than 3,000 people had been infected during almost a week of public silence.  During the six days the world was unaware of the virus, the city of Wuhan - the epicentre of the global outbreak - hosted a mass banquet for tens of thousands of people, and millions began to travel through for Lunar New Year celebrations.  On March 11, the virus was declared a global pandemic by the World Health Organization.  Other reports have also emerged alleging China attempted to cover up its role in the extent of the pandemic by silencing whistleblowers and muzzling scientists, while concerned doctors have ominously disappeared.

"US Navy ship sails through Chinese-claimed waters in South China Sea  29 Apr 2020, 16:07 by AFP  Washington (AFP) - A US Navy guided-missile destroyer sailed through waters near the Paracel islands in the South China Sea challenging China's claim to the area, the Navy said Wednesday.  The USS Barry undertook the so-called ""freedom of navigation operation"" on Tuesday, a week after Beijing upped its claims to the region by designating an official administrative district for the islands.  The US sought to assert the ""rights, freedoms and lawful uses of the sea recognized in international law,"" the Navy said in a statement.  ""Unlawful and sweeping maritime claims in the South China Sea pose an unprecedented threat to the freedom of the seas, including the freedoms of navigation and overflight and the right of innocent passage of all ships,"" it said.  The move came amid a rise in US-China tensions over the novel coronavirus epidemic, in which Washington has accused Beijing of hiding and downplaying the initial outbreak in December and January in the Chinese city of Wuhan.  The United States rejects China's territorial claim to much of the South China Sea, including the Paracels, also claimed by Vietnam and Taiwan.  The region is believed to have valuable oil and gas deposits.  In a statement on the People's Liberation Army website, the Chinese military said it had mobilized sea and air assets to track and warn the US vessel away from ""Chinese territorial waters.""  The PLA accused the United States of ""provocative acts"" that ""seriously violated international law and China's sovereignty and security interests.""  The US action was ""also incompatible with the current joint efforts of international community to fight against the COVID-19,"" it said.  Last week China sought to further advance its territorial claims when it announced that the Paracel and nearby Spratly islands, the Macclesfield Bank and their surrounding waters would be administered under two new districts of Sansha city, which China created on nearby Woody Island in 2012.  It also announced official Chinese names for 80 islands and other geographical features in the South China Sea, including reefs, seamounts, shoals and ridges, 55 of them submerged in water."	News
COVID-19: Sokoto records three deaths – Tambuwal  29 Apr 2020, 16:51 by The Eagle Online   Share on Facebook  Share on Twitter   Tambuwal disclosed this in a statement signed by his Special Adviser on Media and Public Affairs, Malam Muhammad Bello.  The governor noted that all the three victims had history of other diseases such as diabetes, asthma and high blood pressure.  The News Agency of Nigeria reports that the state’s Chairman of the Task Force Committee on COVID-19, Dr. Muhammad Ali Inname, had on Monday confirmed eight new cases of the coronavirus, which took to 10 the total number of infected persons in the state.  Inname, who is also the state’s Commissioner for Health, said eight new cases were recorded on April 26 and were all among the 32 traced contacts from the index case recorded in the state.  He said that the second case was recorded on April 23 and that all the traces had been investigated.  He added that they were all quarantined, while all the positive patients were isolated.  Inname gave an assurance that investigation was still on to unravel the circumstances surrounding the infections, as the first case, which was recorded on April 19, had no travel record.  According to him, at least 59 people have so far been tested in the state.  He added that the testing centre at the Usman Danfodio University Teaching Hospital in Sokoto, was functional and had all the required test kits.  He explained that 279 health personnel were mobilised for the fight against the coronvirus, while about 3,000 volunteers had filled forms to become participants.  Inname said that health workers were among the tested persons and that none came out positive, indicating that the health workers were complying with global safety rules recommended by the World Health Organisation.  The commissioner urged health personnel to always consider other cases beyond the coronavirus such as Lassa fever, Meningitis and Hypertension.  He noted that a committee was constituted to monitor deaths and burials in the cemeteries as well as establish contact with hospital managements on the percentage of deaths to ensure careful and immediate interventions.  He advised people against unnecessary panic, saying the situation was under control.  Inname, however, stressed the need for people to adhere to recommended safety regulations such as hand washing with soap, wearing face masks, use of hand sanitisers, and social distancing, among others.  The committee chairman added that sub-committees against COVID-19 were inaugurated at senatorial zone levels for continuous surveillance at the grassroots to monitor the influx of returnees as well as passers by using remote routes.

He noted that some might be infected and could go on without notice.  Inname commended Tambuwal for his support toward the success of the exercise, saying that retired medical personnel who are indigenes of the state were recalled and placed on the same levels they left service to complement efforts of those still in service.

OnePlus 8 / 8 Pro pre-orders available in India, sales will begin on May 11  29 Apr 2020, 16:31 by Marco Lancaster  The OnePlus 8 and 8 Pro were listed on the company’s India website at last. Customers in the country have been eagerly waiting for the highly-anticipated flagships since their release earlier this month. However, the company had to delay the availability of this device. After all, it was impossible for customers to purchase smartphones in India. Due to the COVID-19, the government imposed huge lockdown policies and stated that retailers would only be able to sell essential goodies. During the past few days, the government decided to relax the quarantine allowing major online retailers to sell smartphones.     Now, the OnePlus 8 series is available for pre-order, however, the actual sales will begin on May 11. To celebrate the start of the sales period the Amazon decided to offer an INR 1,000 (~$13) cashback at Amazon Pay account. Users will need to purchase a gift card worth at least INR1,000 now. Moreover, they’ll need to use it towards the purchase of an OnePlus 8 phone between May 11 and June 30. After 30 days, the company will give INR 1,000 cashback.  OnePlus is also selling its latest smartphone through the company’s local website. The prices start at INR44,990 ($595/€550) and go up to INR59,999 ($800/€730). Unfortunately, customers getting the phone there won’t be prized with any pre-order gift. So for the sake of gifts, the Amazon offer still looks like the best deal.  Source :  Amazon	News
Captain Tom has train named after him by Great Western Railway  29 Apr 2020, 16:09 by Jen Mills  Captain Tom Moore has had a train named after him in honour of his phenomenal fundraising efforts.  The World War Two veteran raised almost £30 million for NHS Charities Together by doing laps of his garden, with the total amount still going up.  Great Western Railway announced that the high speed train will reenter service on April 30 – the date of Captain Tom’s 100th birthday.  The Intercity Express Train 800025 has his name written on the front, alongside a picture of him with his walking frame.  GWR Interim Managing Director Matthew Golton said: ‘With his indomitable spirit what Captain Tom has achieved is truly inspirational, and an example to us all.  ‘We at Great Western have a long history of naming trains after Great Westerners, the past and present heroes from across our network, and I am honoured that today we can respond to requests to have a train named after Captain Tom Moore.’    Tony Harrision, lead technician for GWR cleans signage on the newly named train (Picture: SWNS)     The train also has a picture of Captain Tom (Picture: SWNS)     Captain Tom has raised more than £29 million by walking laps of his garden (Picture: EPA)   In 2016 the company launched a public campaign to name its new fleet of trains after ‘Great Westerners’ – inspirational individuals who have shaped the Great Western network.  Trains named to date include Queen Victoria and Queen Elizabeth II,  Captain Tom, from Marston Moretaine in Bedfordshire, initially hoped to raise £1,000 by walking 100 laps of his garden before his 100th birthday.  That target was broken in about 24 hours and after completing 100 laps a fortnight ahead of schedule, he then extended his challenge to 200 laps.     Captain Tom’s fundraising feat was further boosted when his duet of You’ll Never Walk Alone, with musicals legend Michael Ball, reached No1.  Originally from Keighley in West Yorkshire, Captain Tom joined the British Army in June 1940.  His regiment – the 8th Battalion, the Duke of Wellington’s Regiment – trained in Wadebridge, Cornwall, tasked with coastal defence against a threatened German invasion. He later served on the frontline in Burma.   Get in touch with our news team by emailing us at webnews@metro.co.uk .    For more stories like this, check our news page .	News

Mr. Ficalora, please go ahead.   Joseph Ficalora   Good morning to everyone on the phone and on the webcast, and thank you for joining us today. I hope that all of you are healthy and safe during this unprecedented time. Our immediate thoughts go out to all the individuals and communities impacted by this pandemic. We are also very grateful for the healthcare professionals and all those on the front lines who are battling this crisis every day.  Before I discuss this quarter’s performance, I would like to cover these two topics with you. First, I would like to share with you some of the actions we have taken across the bank to deal with the COVID-19 crisis. It goes without saying that the health and wellbeing of our employees, customers and shareholders is of the utmost importance to management and the board of directors. The company was very proactive during the very early stages of the crisis and immediately enacted a business continuity plan and pandemic preparedness procedures. By mid-March, close to 100% of our bank office employees were working remotely. In addition, we temporarily closed all of our in-store branches along with several of the locations converted to drive-up only and adjusted the hours at our remaining branches.  On the consumer side, we have enhanced our online banking and mobile capabilities temporarily waived certain retail banking fees for those customers who may be experiencing financial difficulties during this time, and offered 90-day payment forbearance to residential mortgage customers.  On the commercial side, we have proactively reached out to borrowers on a case-by-case basis to help them manage through this crisis as well. We put in place several risk mitigation strategies, including enhanced monitoring of certain credits, payment restructuring plans and deferral options consistent with regulatory guidance.  Second, I would like to clear up some misperceptions regarding trends in the rent-regulated multi-family market in New York City. We are not a newcomer to this market. If you recall, at this point we have been doing this type of lending for over 50 years. We have relationships with some of the largest property owners in the city and we have very strong ties to some of the biggest commercial real estate brokers, including the largest one servicing the New York City marketplace. We also have as directors several real estate professionals who participate in this market for a living providing us with a unique perspective on the multi-family market.  Over the past week or so, there has been some discussion about the level of rent collections on our market. With our conservative view on underwriting, we closely monitor a number of trends in the multi-family market, and when things change we reevaluate. During the month of April, we surveyed a wide gamut of our borrowers, including some of our top 20 borrowers. We spoke to brokers and we also reached out to a number of industry experts. Based on our market intelligence, April rent collections on the rent regulated buildings in our portfolio are estimated to be in a range of 80% to 85%. On the market rent properties, it is even higher. This is very encouraging given the impact on the New York City area given the COVID-19 pandemic.  While there are still many uncertainties regarding how the COVID-19 crisis will ultimately unfold, to what degree it will impact the economy over the long run, we believe that we are better positioned than most other financial institutions to navigate through it given our strong credit culture and low operating model. While no two economic cycles are alike, I would impress upon you the fact that throughout various cycles, our actual loan loss experience has been much lower than the rest of the industry.  With that out of the way, let’s turn to our quarterly results.  Earlier this morning, we reported diluted earnings per common share of $0.20 for the three months ended March 31, 2020 - that’s up 5% compared to the year ago quarter and ahead of consensus estimates. Despite what is usually a seasonally slower quarter, we had strong loan growth, a higher level of net interest income and net interest margin expansion, lower operating expenses, and stable asset quality metrics. We exited the first quarter with positive underlying momentum and we are in a strong capital and liquidity position.  Our results include a provision for credit losses of $21 million - that’s 0.05%, far below industry metrics, due to the application of CECL during the quarter. This reflects an additional reserve for the potential impact of COVID-19. This was slightly offset by an income tax benefit due to certain provisions under the CARES Act. That notwithstanding, we are very pleased with our first quarter performance.  We entered the year with strong fundamentals, building off of a solid performance in the fourth quarter of last year. One of the highlights of the quarter is the improvement in both net interest income and the margins. After reaching an inflection point last quarter when these two metrics both increased for the first time in five years, they increased again during the current quarter.  Net interest income excluding the impact of prepayment activity increased $9.3 million or 17% on an annualized basis compared to the previous quarter due to lower interest expense, as funding costs continued to decline. The net interest margin also continued its upward trajectory. Also excluding the impact from prepayment income, the first quarter margin would have been 1.92%, up two basis points and in line with expectations.  We are currently very well positioned for further growth throughout 2020 in both the margin and net interest income, albeit at a higher rate than we experienced during the current quarter. This is due to our liability-sensitive balance sheet, the Fed having lowered its target rate to near zero, and the significant re-pricing opportunities embedded within our funding mix, especially on the CD side. We also reported a strong increase in pre-provision net revenue. PPNR was $135.8 million for the first quarter, up $8.5 million or 6% compared to the year ago quarter.  On the expense front, total non-interest expense was $125.5 million, down 10% from the year ago quarter. The efficiency ratio in the first quarter was 48% and continues to reflect positive operating leverage.  Moving on to the balance sheet, despite the usual beginning of year seasonality, total loans increased almost $400 million or 4% on an annualized basis compared to the fourth quarter. Specialty finance lending and multi-family portfolio continued to be the primary drivers of this growth. The specialty finance business had strong growth this quarter. This portfolio rose $415 million to $3 billion on a linked quarter basis. Meanwhile, the multi-family portfolio increased $113 million to $31.3 billion sequentially.  As I alluded to earlier, given all that has transpired over the last two months, multi-family credit spreads have widened significantly due to market dislocation and less competition, similar to what has occurred in previous cycles. Origination activity was also strong as overall originations increased 35% on a year-over-year basis to $2.7 billion, with both multi-family and specialty finance originations increasing significantly compared to the year ago quarter. First quarter originations exceeded last quarter’s pipeline by $1.2 billion or 80%. Multi-family originations were $1.4 billion, and specialty finance originations were $957 million, both up 40% relative to first quarter of last year.  We continue to be encouraged by our potential loan growth over the course of this year. Our pipeline currently stands at $2.1 billion, 40% higher than the fourth quarter and year ago pipeline. Of the $2.1 billion, approximately 64% is new money.  On the funding side, our deposit growth continued into the first quarter as well. Total deposits rose $316 million or 4% annualized to $32 billion. Most of this growth was in lower cost savings and non-interest bearing checking accounts, while CDs declined modestly. Wholesale borrowings also increased as we took advantage of the low interest rate environment to replace matured borrowings with lower cost, longer duration borrowings. Borrowings increased $375 million to $14.3 billion during the current quarter.  On the asset quality side, as discussed in more detail in our earnings release, we reported a $21 million provision for credit losses, mainly driven by COVID-19. Net charge-offs totaled $10 million or 0.02% of average loans, $6.5 million of which was taxi medallion related loans. That portfolio continues to be in run-off mode and currently stands at $33.5 million. Importantly, we had no losses in our core portfolio. The adoption of CECL did not have a material impact on our asset quality metrics as they remained strong during the quarter.  Non-performing assets declined $15 million or 20% to $59 million compared to the level at year-end, or 11 basis points of total assets. As with charge-offs, the largest component of NPAs is taxi medallion loans. Excluding taxi medallion-related loans, NPAs would have been $36 million or 7 basis points of total assets.  As noted in today’s investor presentation, $18.7 billion or 60% of our total multi-family portfolio is subject to New York State rent regulation laws. The weighted average LTV on this piece of the portfolio is 53% compared to 57% for the overall multi-family portfolio, unchanged from the previous quarter.  Lastly, we also announced that the board of directors declared a $0.17 cash dividend per common share for the quarter. The dividend will be payable on May 19 to common shareholders of record as of May 9. Based on yesterday’s closing price, this represents an annualized dividend yield of 6.6%.  Before moving on to your questions, I would like to make a final comment. At NYCB, we are not just a community bank. We are a family, and when things get difficult, our family comes together. I am extremely proud of all the efforts every employee has made to ensure that we continue to service our customers. This has been a very challenging, stressful period for everyone, and I am proud at how the entire organization has come together and risen to the challenge. A very big collective thank you to all of our 3,000 employees throughout our franchise.  Lastly, our prayers go out to all those members of the NYCB family past and present who are suffering from COVID-19 and particularly those employees, their families and friends who have lost due to disease.  On that note, I would now ask the operator to open the line to your questions. We will do our best to get to all of you in the remaining time, but if we don’t, please feel free to call us later today or this week.   Question-and-Answer Session    Operator   [Operator instructions]  Our first question is from Ebrahim Poonawala with Bank of America. Please proceed.   Joseph Ficalora   Good morning, Ebrahim.   Ebrahim Poonawala   Good morning. I guess just to follow up, Joe, on your comments about the multi-family borrower base, I guess my sense is we will probably see an uptick in rent deferrals when we look at the May 1 read data, so those numbers will probably go from 80% to 85% to something lower, so would love to get your thoughts on that, and additionally if you can talk about the strength of your customer base, given as the LTVs in the low 50s, what’s the risk in terms of, from a credit standpoint, to NYB and what level of payment deferrals have you provided to your clients in the last month or so?   Joseph Ficalora   Tom, you want to take that?   Thomas Cangemi   Yes, sure. Ebrahim, good morning, it’s Tom Cangemi. Joe can address the market, but I’ll clearly give the specifics on what we’ve done with our customers. We were very quick to react to obviously this pandemic and to support the customer base, so we offered right out of the--mid-March when the government shut down the country, the ability for customers to come to us and defer for a period of six months, and part of that deferral was they have to be current at the time they entered into a deferral agreement and they have to be also paying their escrow payments throughout that period.  That being said, actually as of yesterday, which is almost starting out of May, we have approximately $3 billion of multi or 9.63% of the entire multi portfolio that’s in a deferral agreement. If you’re thinking about the entire portfolio and add to it CRE, it’s approximately $4.8 billion and the CRE piece of that, I believe is approximately $1.8 billion, and total percentage of the CREs approximately 26%. All in, it’s about 12.6% of multi-family, CRE of $4.8 billion, and the LTV of that portfolio that’s on deferral is 57%, and that’s as of yesterday, so that’s real time.   Ebrahim Poonawala   And it’s a 90-day deferral, Tom. Is your expectation that--   Thomas Cangemi   That’s a six-month deferral. It’s 90 days on the residential side.   Ebrahim Poonawala   If we start seeing these lockdowns open up, let’s call it somewhere around June-July, is it your sense that most of these borrowers or all of these borrowers will go back to being current, looking out in the third quarter towards the end of the year?   Thomas Cangemi   Ebrahim, I don’t have a crystal ball, but I can give you the actual specific collections as of yesterday. We’re looking at, when you take into account deferrals as well as people that have not deferred, we’re up to 97.73% of April collections compared to all of the previous months around the same level. When you back out deferrals for the multi-family, that’s at 91% versus 97%, so we’re really not seeing a significant adjustment here on payments coming through, so we’re very pleased on the current collection efforts that are going on as of yesterday.   Ebrahim Poonawala   Understood. Just moving away from multi-family, Tom, when you look at the other CRE book, I think CRE retail is obviously under the scanner. Just talk to us in terms of the risk exposure there, particularly to any mall retail, high end, and also with any risk on the specialty finance book, which has grown a lot over the last couple of years.   Thomas Cangemi   Sure, so obviously the percentage of deferral is higher for commercial real estate, in particular looking at retail and office and the like, so we expected that, especially on the mixed use properties. I’d say the highest percentage would be the mixed use properties, where you have smaller buildings that have a higher concentration of retail on the ground floor and you have residential above that. That number is probably in the 40 th percentile. When you think about what we call pure retail and office, 23% for office and professional buildings and retail is at 27%. When you blend those numbers in for the portfolio, it’s 26%.  But clearly the higher level is going to be, as expected, there’s no revenue coming in on the ground floor. On the multi side, we happen to have some very interesting statistics. The larger the buildings, the much lower the amount of deferrals, so buildings that have in excess of 100-plus families living in the building, that’s like a 6% deferral rate, so it’s much lower, so it’s 6% type versus the retail, which could be substantially higher because there’s no revenue coming through.  On specialty finance, I would tell you that as we stand right now, everything is current, no missed payments. We feel pretty confident on the portfolio given our senior security and our position, and we’ve been growing that portfolio very nicely. Again, we’re an asset-based lender, we feel that we don’t have significant exposure that’s COVID related. We do have some energy, a couple hundred [indiscernible] in energy, but that’s all super senior secured to very stable institutions. On the auto side, which is dealer floor plan, we believe that portfolio will do well given the PPP program, as well as the ability to get up and running towards the end of the year with their option to take on deferrals and eventually get these dealerships opened up again. We think that portfolio, we should have zero losses in the specialty finance business.   Ebrahim Poonawala   Got it, that’s helpful. Just one separately and last one on the margin. You have [indiscernible] funding coming up for refi. Just talk to us in terms of the new deposit rates offered, and if you can provide some cadence of [indiscernible] backdrop if it stays where it is, given the spread widening on the lending side. What level of margin expansion should we expect between now through [indiscernible] just one quarter, or if you can talk to the next few quarters, what is the level of margin you expect to end 2020.   Thomas Cangemi   Sure. I’d say big picture as we talked about, going back to 2019, we said there was an inflection point in the fourth quarter, the margin started to rise in Q4 with the anticipation of seeing significant rises going into 2020, with the exception obviously of substantial adjustments in interest rates. Obviously the Fed has intervened here, so it’s a little close to a near zero Fed fund rate; but that being said, we did hit our guidance for Q1 as expected of 2, but when you think about second quarter margin, we’re seeing more likely than not double-digit margin expansion.  We believe that throughout 2020, we anticipate double digit every quarter, so we’re going to have substantial margin expansion given our liability sensitivity balance sheet, and more importantly, we have a substantial amount of CDs coming due, as you can see form the press release, we put the numbers out there. It’s approximately $14.8 billion coming due in the second quarter, it’s $6 billion coming due out of 235, and in the event that you have a CD rolling off in this environment, you’re going to end up in a, probably more likely than not, a level well below 50 basis points.  If you think about the potential there, $6 billion in Q2, Q3 is almost $5 billion at 2.06, these rates are coming down well below 1%, so the margin is really going to be driven by a number of factors. We have the CD costs dropping materially, funding cost is dropping on the borrowing side. If you look at what borrowings are right now on two-year bullets at 74 basis points with a swap that’s close to effectively zero, and you think about the money coming through on the borrowing side, and if we’re growing the portfolio, depending on how we grow it with deposits and no borrowings, the cost is relatively cheap.  But more importantly, there’s been a real change in pricing in respect to the multi-family CRE space. I mean, no question that there’s been some dislocation with CMBS players on the sidelines, you have the agencies tightening up their standards, so we’re looking at north of 300 basis point increase in our product mix. If you were to come to the bank today with, we’ll call it an A-type credit, five-year structure, our typical bread and butter structure, you’re at a 3.5% coupon. That’s pretty attractive compared to where five-year treasuries are trading at right now, so we’re very bullish about the economic spreads on the product mix, we’re extremely bullish on the drop in the cost of funds, so we can see double digit margin expansion every quarter throughout 2020, and that would be assuming credit costs are in check, you’re looking at EPS growth in the mid-teens.   Ebrahim Poonawala   Got it. Thanks for taking my questions.   Thomas Cangemi   Sure.   Operator   Our next question is from Brock Vandervliet with UBS. Please proceed.   Thomas Cangemi   Morning Brock.   Operator   Brock, please check to see if your phone is muted.   Brock Vandervliet   Sorry.   Thomas Cangemi   Morning Brock.   Brock Vandervliet   Good morning. Could you kind of dive into the multi-family credit spreads? I think we all saw the dislocation in March. It seemed like the GSCs kind of pulled themselves out of the market. Why doesn’t this mean revert, and how much of that aggressive margin guide is based on the current pricing holding?   Thomas Cangemi   Again, we don’t have a crystal ball what happens with interest rates, but clearly it seems like rates are going to stay low for a while here, given the pandemic and the circumstances. We have in our run rate, we’ll just talk about 2020, the Fed not doing anything in 2020. At the same time, we’ve been through many crises and cycles and we’ve seen adjustments within the marketplace, and clearly--go back to the 2008 adjustment. You had massive dislocation. You had CMBS, you had the agency out of business back then. We’re not saying that the agency is out of business, but the agency has clearly tightened their standards. They’ve widened their spreads. There is a premium risk-reward that’s priced in the marketplace, and we’re enjoying that healthier spread.  I think what’s most important here when we talk about asset growth, we’re anticipating 5% net loan growth but we’re seeing substantial, savable results on retention as we ended up the quarter, so as we go into Q2 we think our retention level will be higher, and we have well over $15 billion in the next three years coming due from our own customer base, so we believe we’ll retain a high percentage of that, unlike we did last year.  So I think the fact that the competition has waned significantly, 300 basis point spread with funding costs coming down to zero, it can be a very powerful margin expansion story here at NYCB.   Brock Vandervliet   Okay, and you were going through these numbers very quickly. Could you just review again the CRE and multi-family forbearance percentage?   Thomas Cangemi   Sure - $3 billion as of yesterday that we’ve entered into agreements on forbearance for multi-family, $1.8 billion for CRE, which is office and retail predominantly, on a percentage basis that’s 12.6% in total, 9.6% multi, 26.4% on CRE. LTV in the total portfolio is 57% of that deferral.   Brock Vandervliet   Okay, great. Thank you.   Thomas Cangemi   Sure.   Operator   Our next question is from Steve Moss with B. Riley FBR. Please proceed.   Steve Moss   Good morning. On the loan growth here, just want to see--you know, you talk about pretty strong pipeline here. Any updated thoughts around total loan growth here for the year?   Thomas Cangemi   You want to handle that one, Joe?   Joseph Ficalora   I think idea here is that, as always is the case, when the market is stressed, we get a greater share of the market. We do believe that we’ll be growing our loans at least at the levels of last year and well likely in excess of the levels of last year. The important thing is that in this crisis, our principle asset will greatly outperform and our ability to take share of the marketplace will increase. Both of those factors have always been the case in a stressed environment. We do believe that the period ahead will represent an environment where many of the other lenders in our niche will lend less and we will lend more.   Thomas Cangemi   Steve, I would just add some more color on our projections. Obviously we’re projecting a mid-single digit, which is 5%. We’re pretty bullish about the pipeline and more importantly, going back to my dialog as far as retention, it feels like our team has done a phenomenal job on really conveying that we’re really fighting for that retention, so we moved that retention rate back up to historical norms, which typically will happen when a lot of competition is waning. We should see the potential, as Joe indicated, of higher growth, but for conservative purposes we feel comfortable that 5% net loan growth is reasonable for the company. I think this year you’ll probably see more on the multi-family side than--you’ll still have strong growth on the specialty, but multi-family should be back loaded here, especially in Q2. Obviously Q2 is usually a strong quarter for us.   Steve Moss   Great. Then just in terms of underwriting standards here, any changes as you’re getting new customers approaching the bank?   Thomas Cangemi   I would add that we have made some changes. Obviously given the marketplace, we’ve tightened the standards, in particular when cash money refi coming out of a transaction, we feel that we have a lot more flexibility now given the marketplace, so we’re actually--when we do a transaction with a cash-out type refi, we’re actually holding six months of both P&I and escrow payments in escrow with the bank, so that’s one of the major changes we’ve done in this environment.  Obviously you can imagine that when the environment gets tighter--you know, we’re one of the tightest underwriters in the marketplace, so we’re going to continue to be there for our customers but we’re going to be there at a very conservative level, and that’s the hallmark of the company.   Steve Moss   Great. Then on funding costs here, interest bearing deposit costs down 12 basis points. I hear you in terms of significant re-pricing. Just wondering if you could put a little bit more in terms of what you would expect this quarter versus the first quarter.   Thomas Cangemi   I would say the continuation of substantial declines in deposit costs is real. We have a unique situation going in particular. We were in the epicenter, so it’s very difficult to go out to the branch and change their deposits when CDs are coming due, so many people are just very comfortable for safety reasons keeping their cash in the bank.  With that being said, people that were at 2.75 last year or 2.50 are going down to close to two basis points today, and so they come back to the branch or make a phone call and try to get a higher rate, and my guess is that given where the marketplace is, you’re looking at rates that are going to probably be south of 50 basis points for between one and two-year type periods. We do have an offering now but there’s no real takers on that type of coupon at 75 to 90 basis points, but the reality is we’re going to be continuing lowering our rates unless there’s a change in the market, because we’re looking at close to zero percent interest rates. Being a thrift, we’re very stable when it comes to targeting for some spread off of the U.S. treasury, which is at a very low rate, so we feel highly confident that the substantial amount coming due of $14.7 billion, in particular Q2 $6 billion in the middle of the epicenter, at 2.35 will drop materially lower for us.   Steve Moss   Great. Then on the energy exposure that you just mentioned, Tom, you said a couple hundred million in energy, senior secured. Just wondering what type of loan it is and where it’s located.   Thomas Cangemi   It’s equipment for--Farmer J is our largest client there. They’re a household name, large institution. We’ve been lending to them for multiple years, since we started the business, and they’ve drawn down on some facilities, but it’s all senior secured and we have it at a pretty high rate on our scale. I think it’s about a 5, John, 4 or 5? It’s a high rated, internally classified asset, however we feel highly confident that it’s money good, and in particular it’s a household name that has very strong fundamentals, but more importantly it’s super senior secured, so it’s not a loan to [indiscernible] of the corporation but on its equipment.   Steve Moss   Great, thank you very much.   Thomas Cangemi   You’re welcome.   Operator   Our next question is from Collyn Gilbert from KBW. Please proceed.   Thomas Cangemi   Morning Collyn.   Collyn Gilbert   Morning gentlemen. First question just on the pipeline, really strong pipeline obviously this quarter. Do you have a sense of how that is going to behave going into 2Q? Tom, I know you just mentioned you expect strong loan growth in 2Q, but just curious what your borrower behavior is, how closings are getting done, to maybe what the pull through rate is on that pipeline, and then also what the blended rate is on that pipeline [indiscernible].   Thomas Cangemi   Let me take the easy one first. The blended rate is about 3.26 as of yesterday, but if you think about how it evolved, when you go to the end of quarter, spreads widen out materially. We started with the rent regulatory changes in last year, where we went from 150 to 200 basis points because of the change in the rent control market, and then we hit the pandemic and now we’re north of 300, so it really was a change in the marketplace toward the back end of the quarter.  This is more of an evolving pipeline that we’re going to see throughout the year, but the business that we’re out there getting good flows of opportunity right now within our own portfolio and others, as you indicated, our new money pipeline is about 64%, you’re seeing a much higher coupon relevant to the current--the one I just cited at 3.25. It’s going to take some time to work through the bank, but clearly we’ve never--I don’t think we’ve ever closed less than what we’ve announced in our pipeline. I can’t remember ever where we announced the pipeline and we didn’t close at a minimum our pipeline.  So we’re looking at a $2.1 billion pipeline in Q2, so you can assume we’d close that and some. And Collyn, one thing I would say as a proviso, assuming that the market reopens, right? We had great closings in a very difficult environment where we had to get attorneys together, appraisers together. We get actual appraisals - we’re not--we are in the marketplace closing loans on a daily basis with all these operational issues out there. Assuming that the country reopens, that will only be better for us.   Collyn Gilbert   Okay, but your assumption that you close that pipeline, like let’s assume things don’t open, certainly not in New York City for, I don’t know--   Thomas Cangemi   Assuming the lawyers are in business and assuming the banks are still funding, we’ll be funding. We went through a pretty difficult March and April, right, so--and we had some very significant originations. We had substantial originations.   Collyn Gilbert   Okay, and then just on the amount that you deferred, you gave 57% LTVs on those loans. Would you know what the debt service coverage is on those loans?   Thomas Cangemi   Yes, sure. Debt service coverage at 1.74 for the--that’s the commercial real estate portfolio, and 1.53 for the multi.   Collyn Gilbert   And that’s for the deferred loans, or that’s for the broader book?   Thomas Cangemi   That’s only for the deferred loans, that’s right.   Collyn Gilbert   Okay, that’s helpful. Then of those deferred, how much of those were going to be coming due contractually anyway this year?   Thomas Cangemi   I don’t have that number for you. Again, I would guess probably not many, but I can follow up with you offline on that. I think what’s interesting about the program--you know, we were very active, and obviously it was publicized within one day that we’re doing this, so people, when you read the real deal, it’s public that we’re doing this program, and people call and we offered it, and more importantly we’ve done our own due diligence on each customer, and the fact that you have to have your escrows current, you have to be current on the payment, and we worked out a six-month arrangement, we think that liquidity backstop for them for the next six months will be very helpful to get to the other side of this problem we have, this pandemic in the United States. We think that six month time should be reasonable.  You know, we could have done a shorter period, but we think six months is more reasonable because it’s going to take a few months here to gather in particular on the ground floor for businesses, but we think it’s a reasonable time frame, that we can at least have the landlords work it out with their tenants so we can move forward and be supportive of them, given the crisis.   Collyn Gilbert   Okay. Along those lines, and you sort of answered it, but just broadly, obviously sitting in unprecedented times. Your book has not been tested to this degree, I don’t think--I wouldn’t even say 9/11 tested it like it does right now. How does that impact the way that you’re thinking about the reserve? I mean, it was a modest reserve build this quarter. Just broadly, given the risks that are out there, how are you thinking about [indiscernible].   Thomas Cangemi   Collyn, I’m going to actually defer the time test. Joe Ficalora has been with the bank well over 50 years. Joe, maybe you want to talk about the time tested as far as your experience and multiple decades more than I have?   Joseph Ficalora   Well, I think the good news, we are structured such that this adverse change, which of course was not anticipated, is not all that different than many other reasons why a marketplace deteriorates and payments are deferred or otherwise evaporate. The environment we’re in presents challenge, but none of this challenge actually changes the reasonable expectations that our owners will in fact remain stable, our buildings will remain stable, and much, much more importantly we cultivate relationships that are way bigger than isolated properties that are funded by us.  The very people that have each and every loan with us in many cases are extremely large players in the New York market, and they have long history with us and the opportunity that a deteriorating market represents, and in every deteriorating market the large players buy. In every circumstance when they’re buying in a deteriorating market, we fund. There is a very big difference between having a relationship with us and having a relationship with a giant bank or with another bank.  Many other banks literally vacate the space because they’re experiencing so much adverse performance, they’re not willing to continue to lend within the space. We are not having adverse performance and we gain share during periods of crisis. The period ahead will literally provide for us additional market share, and that additional market share will give us the ability to grow our book with good product and better than existing rates. The ability for us to earn on our principle asset go forward is actually better than it has been for a long period of time.   Thomas Cangemi   So Collyn, I’ll address the reserve point. Joe gave a good history of the bank, and obviously he’s been here for many decades. As far as the reserve is concerned, assuming COVID did not happen, we’d guided in the first quarter for CECL that there would really be no impact at all, other than a transitional adjustment that we took. If you take COVID out of the equation for the first quarter, you’re looking at probably close to a zero provision in first quarter 2020. That’s kind of how we looked at the COVID analysis.  In particular, we actually did some more quantitative adjustments just because of the Moody’s change as far as their view of unemployment going into 2020, in the second and third quarter. We’re a conservative institution that has a history of really no losses in the marketplace, and these are predominantly residential units that are housing people in the city of New York, so we feel highly confident that our loss content is low. But you know, we booked a sizeable adjustment that we didn’t anticipate because of COVID-19.   Collyn Gilbert   Okay, all right. Just lastly, I wanted to clarify, there is some confusion, at least to me, the way the press release was written. I know the share count move happened in the first quarter. What did you guys buy back this quarter?   Thomas Cangemi   It’s in the press release. I mean, we were slightly active, and we have a little bit left. We’ll evaluate the market depending on market conditions, but it’s really not a material number left as of--yes, it’s very small, a couple--what is it, 30 million left? So the buyback is not significant that’s left, but we did buy shares in the quarter given the price action in the quarter, sure.   Collyn Gilbert   Okay. The actual share number is in the press release, that you bought back this quarter?   Thomas Cangemi   I think the difference, right? We have the numbers on the second page, John? Yes, it’s in there, second page.   Collyn Gilbert   Okay, and you did not issue any shares then in the quarter?   Thomas Cangemi   Oh, just normal plan. You know, it’s netted against the plan. When you look at the share count in the back of the documentation, it’s netted against [indiscernible] for shares. I would say probably what we’ve bought back is what we’ve issued for MRP shares. No significant change there. We don’t have a material buyback in place. It’s insignificant.   Collyn Gilbert   Got it, okay. I will leave it there.   Thomas Cangemi   That doesn’t mean that we’re not buying back shares, right? We’re not halting anything. We feel very bullish about our business and we pay a very strong dividend. We’re comfortable that given the guidance I gave you, albeit credit issues which were unforeseen credit issues, we’re looking at significant EPS growth and, more importantly, double digit margin growth every quarter throughout 2020, and you’ll see growth continue through 2021 but I don’t want to get too ahead of myself. But clearly, this has been a significant change of our funding costs going forward, so you’ll see Q1 up 10 basis points Q1, versus up 2--sorry, Q2 versus up 2 in Q1. That’s a substantial change. We envision that change continuing in Q3 and Q4 as well.   Collyn Gilbert   Okay, very good. I’ll leave it there, thank you.   Thomas Cangemi   Sure.   Operator   Our next question is from Dave Rochester with Compass Point. Please proceed.   Dave Rochester   Morning guys. Just back on the CRE book real quick, what was the total retail exposure you had, how large is that segment roughly, and can you just talk about a rough breakdown of that, what that is, whether it’s mixed use, strip centers, whatnot?   Thomas Cangemi   Again, we have approximately a $1.7 billion of retail stores-slash-shopping centers, of which we indicated about $470 million of that is deferred. That LTV in that portfolio is, like, 56% with a 1.70 debt service coverage ratio. As far as further breakdown, we do have office and professional buildings in the CRE book, which is the vast majority of it. That’s about $3.5 billion, of which $830 million is deferred, which is 22%, and that LTV, I believe, is about a 52% with a 1.85 debt service coverage ratio, a lot of it mostly in the Manhattan region.   Dave Rochester   And pretty low LTVs too, that’s good.   Thomas Cangemi   Oh yeah. I mean, we have a handful of garages that there’s no people going to parking garages, so that’s going to be deferred, and it’s not material for us but you’d expect that to go for a deferral program until they start opening up the city again.   Dave Rochester   Yes. Then you guys gave some great color on the cash flow trends for the rent regulated multi-family piece, and I know you hold most of that at a 50% risk weight given the loans meet certain debt service coverage and LTV requirements. Was just wondering what those thresholds are for debt service coverage and LTV that they have to continue to meet in order to maintain that capital treatment, and then do the loans have to switch to 100% risk weight if you trigger one of those thresholds or do they have to trigger both? How does that work?   Thomas Cangemi   It’s 120 is the number - 120, and 80% LTV, 120. We’ve been in constant dialog with obviously our regulators, but the reality is this regulatory expectation under the CARES Act is to work with the customers. We’re getting some very good latitude now based on this change under the 50 versus 100%. We envision that after these customers come off of deferral, they’ll be treated as if they were 50% risk weighted. That’s what we’re expecting.  Could that change? Possibly. We don’t expect that to change. We believe that the CARES Act was very clear for the banking sector to work with your customers, so I believe that we’ll have some grandfathering in when we make these deferrals, and when they come back, we hope that there will be cash flowing north of that 120 and the LTVs will be well insulated. We don’t know if that’s going to be the final ruling, what the regulators decide a year from now, but clearly there’s a lot of regulatory guidance and we’ve been working directly with our regulators as far as some specific guidance given [indiscernible]. We feel highly confident that when we get to the other side, people will be living in Manhattan and the five boroughs and paying their rent.   Dave Rochester   If you have to restructure any of those and the restructured loan actually meets all the criteria, is it okay, or if because you’ve restructured it, it actually has to go to 100% risk weight?   Thomas Cangemi   I think that would be fine on the restructuring, but again I don’t want to put the cart before the horse. Again, we feel highly confident that as we get to the other side, people are going to be living and working in the city, and we believe that--you know, there’s still a housing shortage in Manhattan. There’s still a rent regulated shortage in Manhattan, so we think they’ll be fully occupied. We’re not in the luxury market. We’re non-luxury lenders, right, so even though our buildings have a blend of rent regulated, a lot of the piece is non-luxury for the most part.  We have a unique portfolio, so in the event the market was to re-price itself down as far as rentals, we’re insulated because we’re not looking after the luxury market, so we feel pretty confident. We don’t have a crystal ball. This is, as Collyn said, untested times, but we’re working with our customers and, given the percentage that has occurred, the good news in the past week or so, we haven’t seen any upticks of more people asking for deferrals, so we’re almost sitting here in May, we think a lot of that has been out already. We’ll monitor every month, and the next time we speak to you next quarter, we’ll have an update. But the good news is that here we are coming into May, and we don’t see the spike in additional requests.   Dave Rochester   Yes, okay. Then how often do you have to do that 50% test? Is that once a quarter, or once a year? When does that happen?   Thomas Cangemi   We do it every quarter, depending on what loan comes due as far as their review. Sure, quarterly. It’s a quarterly analysis, and it’s all automated quarterly.   Dave Rochester   Cool, okay. Maybe just one last one on expenses. How are you thinking about that trend at this point? I think you were talking about 515, maybe, for the year on the last call. Is that still a level you think you can achieve?   Thomas Cangemi   Yes, it seems that--look, I think that Q1 was better than expected. I think Q2 will probably be slightly better than expected internally, so anywhere from 128 to 129-ish, just slightly south of 130, and then maybe flat for the rest of the year. Again, we’re not seeing a ramp-up in expenses.  Now, we don’t anticipate substantial expense because of COVID-19, but we’ll evaluate that as we move along here. I would say based on absent the pandemic versus last year, I think our expense guide is still within that range. I don’t see any major change here. I would say the only real change is that we haven’t completed our conversion, and that would have probably added some savings, but it gets postponed because of the stay-at-home order. We anticipate to have that once New York opens up. Hopefully by the summer, we’ll be able to do the full conversion.   Dave Rochester   Okay. All right, thanks guys.   Thomas Cangemi   Sure.   Operator   Our next question is from Peter Winter with Wedbush Securities. Please proceed.   Thomas Cangemi   Morning Pete.   Peter Winter   Tom, the ones that reach contractual maturity and then get refinanced, can you just talk about what’s happening to the LTVs with those loans, and also what’s happening with the cap rates versus the new rent regulation laws?   Thomas Cangemi   Yes, so we evaluated our cap rates post--I’d say pre-pandemic, and we actually saw a slight drop in cap rates, believe it or not. We didn’t change the way we viewed our stress testing because of that. We do it every six months. We evaluate the market, so from June 30 to 12/31, cap rates actually trickled down a little bit, believe it or not. In our internal analysis when we look at stress testing and how we look at the potential risks, we assumed--we kept it flat without decreasing it.  I would say that it’s too early to tell how that’s going to pan out in their environment, but interest rates - again, near zero. We have a higher spread, but you’re still talking about a mid-3% type coupon, so we haven’t seen any noticeable changes yet. Who knows what happens in the next two or three quarters out, but clearly no noticeable change in cap rates.  With that being said, when we have loans that come due to us, we haven’t seen any situations where customers can’t cash flow out on a refinance. If anything, customers are still actively taking down funding because they’ve improved their rent roll. They’ve been working--so these are, I would say, delayed refinancing. When you have an average life that this short, you’d assume that the portfolio is so short because people have delayed their refinancing, so they still have equity build and they’re still drawing down equity. Like I said, given this environment, given the nature of the difficulties in the environment, we’re actually tightening our standards on refi cash-out, where actually we’re holding in escrow both taxes and P&I payments for a period of six months as part of our strategy to mitigate risk.   Peter Winter   Then can I just ask about how big the PPP program is, and with this downturn, is it an opportunity to take market share from the larger banks aside from the multi-family business?   Thomas Cangemi   Yes, so Pete, for us--look, you know we’re not a C&I lender, we’re a commercial real estate lender and mostly multi-family, so we got geared up. We were a little bit late on getting geared up, we worked with a third party provider, so we partnered with a third party provider, and we were very active on the second round, so our PPP numbers are going to be between $100 million to $200 million at best. However, a lot of the customers that we have internally we’re putting through the system and we’re getting great success. Our team has done a phenomenal job in getting it up and running.  But it’s interesting - these are more anecdotal, a lot of our, what we’ll call customers coming from other banks, Bank of America, JP Morgan, Citibank in particular, where they had no results. These are smaller businesses that were left behind on the first round. We put them through the second round and they were successful, and believe it or not, they’re switching their accounts to NYCB. You still have to go through the vetting process, you still have to go through the BSA process - there’s a lot of work, but many small businesses were left behind locally, so we’re there for them. We’re actively taking some new business. I won’t say it’s going to be material, but I think on an anecdotal basis, there’s no question that the larger players were protecting their book, and we were there to pick up a handful of [indiscernible] to help out the local community.  As Joe said this morning, it’s a family here. These are local businesses that need help, and we’re here to help the local community. It’s not a big number for us, but we are in the program.   Peter Winter   Got it. Thanks Tom.   Thomas Cangemi   Sure.   Operator   Our next question is from Christopher Marinac from Janney Montgomery Scott. Please proceed.   Christopher Marinac   Good morning. Thank you for all your information this morning. If we go back to the beginning of the call when Joe mentioned the implied survey of 85% collected in April, would that number get stronger in May and June, do you think, and does that ultimately square with the deferrals that you talked about this morning?   Thomas Cangemi   Joe, you want to handle that one?   Joseph Ficalora   I think that number does continue to strengthen. We’re in a very, very good place with the relevant players in our niche, so our ability to not only have a performing portfolio but a growing portfolio in the period ahead is quite real. It’s very consistent with how we perform in other stressed environments. We should assume the period ahead to be stressed, and during that period we will gain share of what we want from the marketplace, and therefore as has always been the case, during periods of difficulty, we do not just better than our peers but better than we historically have done. This environment presents opportunity for us to lend favorably in greater numbers in the environment in front of us.   Thomas Cangemi   I would just add to Joe’s commentary, big picture, our portfolio--you know, we’re a very large player in this marketplace, so we have 100-plus families in some of these large buildings and clutches of buildings. When you think about the percentage of deferral versus all the other deferrals, that’s the lowest percentage. That means we’re getting significant rent collections. These are very sophisticated billionaire property owners that have deep valued equity that are going to protect their investment, but more importantly they’re not even asking for deferrals. The program is out there, and only 6% has come to the table on the 100-plus family dwellings, which is very encouraging.  Now, the smaller ones, obviously it’s a higher percentage because you have that ground floor issue and you can have zero percent revenue coming in, so going through the next months ahead as the country opens up and the city opens up, and they start working out their lease arrangements with their tenants, we envision that, in the next six month period, to start to stabilize.   Christopher Marinac   Great, that’s helpful. Just a follow-up, Tom, my impression has been that you still are sitting on enormous liquidity to deploy, and that liquidity really presents new opportunities for you, both on the investment side as well as loans, as you’ve documented. Will that get put to work in the next two quarters, or do you think it’s going to take into next year to really deploy your full horsepower?   Thomas Cangemi   Chris, we do have a lot of liquidity on the balance sheet. We have excess cash. We sold some securities going into the second quarter, actually middle of the first quarter given that we felt that rates were going to go much lower than they were. These were floating rate securities that would have been having close to zero percent yields - that was about $300 million, so that created a lot of cash for us. We believe that will be put right back into our core lending product, so we want to stay liquid, we want to have the [indiscernible] any risk reward opportunity there and put it into our loan portfolio, which as Joe said, as Joe indicated, if this continues and we’re in a difficult cycle, we tend to have significant growth. We’re only forecasting 5%, but you can easily see a substantial number of growth because of the retention that we’d have within our own portfolio and the lack of market players willing to step into this market.   Christopher Marinac   Great Tom. Thank you again, appreciate it.   Thomas Cangemi   Sure.   Operator   Our next question is from Matthew Breese with Stephens. Please proceed.   Matthew Breese   Hey, good morning. Looking at the borrowings book, I’ve been surprised that the costs there haven’t come in more. Can you give us the breakdown between the structured advances and the classic advances, and help me better understand how the structured advance side behaves and re-prices relative to changes in the yield curve.   Thomas Cangemi   Yes, so we have about, what, $8 billion, John?   John Pinto   Yes, $8 billion in putables.   Thomas Cangemi   Eight billion in putables. It’s interesting because obviously in January, the environment was different than the end of March, right, so we had some money coming due at the beginning of the quarter, we refinanced that at lower cost based on what was coming off; however, where we are today, that number is close to zero if you hedge it, if you put a derivative against it, and if you just go with straight bullets you’re still at a number that’s probably, what, 50 basis points, 45, 50 basis points? We’re at 74 basis points for two-year bullets, so I think the cost is coming down materially.  We have been active when we look at the opportunity to get a unique swap opportunity, so that probably drives it maybe anywhere from 25 to 50, depending on the anomaly of the marketplace, and there’s been a lot of anomalies, so you could effectively borrow money, swap it out from float to fixed, fixed to float, and then you’re looking at a zero percent effective interest rate, which is unique.  But the reality is that it’s significantly lower than our current cost that’s coming due, which is around 2% in 2020, the remainder of 2020. We have about $1.2 billion coming to this quarter, another $300 million, $400 million in Q3, another $300 million at the end of the year, and they’re all around 2% - 1.85 is Q2, and then the back half of the year, it’s 2.38 and--it’s 2.38 for the six months ended. So again--   Matthew Breese   I’m sorry, are you putting that on at a--are you more apt to put on the structured with a swap at 50 BPs, or are you going to take the classic at 75?   Thomas Cangemi   You know, we may just keep it short and just borrow 45 basis points [indiscernible]. We have opportunities. We don’t see the Fed actively driving interest rates higher here, so we have options. But the options are still all well below 1%, so conservatively in our model, we have high cost--now, I gave you double digit margin expansion with expensive funding, so I’m assuming [indiscernible] funding will be cheaper. I’m hoping my guide on my margin is even conservative up double digits.   Matthew Breese   Is that the risk to that portfolio, that interest rates go higher and the Fed--the federal home loan has the right to call it?   Thomas Cangemi   Well, not if they call it. If rates go up 400 basis points, they're going to call it; but again, if you think rates are going up 400 basis points, that not what we’re running in our model. We have the Fed remaining flat this year. I’m not going to talk about 2021, I’m talking about 2020, and I don’t envision any real changes to policy given the current situation. But that being said, in the event a putable structure gets called and rates are up, you’ll have higher borrowing costs. That’s correct.   Matthew Breese   Okay, understood. Then what’s the incremental securities yield? That book on a quarter-over-quarter basis fell quite a bit. Just curious what the incremental--you know, what does it look like? If you do buy, what are you buying and what’s the yield on it?   Thomas Cangemi   Yes, so like I said, we’re not buying anything, we’re just keeping it flat, so we still get called out. We have some called expected, so let’s just say we may have a few basis point bleed next quarter. If not, it could be flat this quarter, depending on what pre-pays and speeds. We do have some mortgage-related securities, it’s all agency for the most part, so we’re not really in the market buying. I would say that unless we see a significant dislocation in security yields and there’s attractive opportunity, we’ll keep it flat.   Matthew Breese   Okay. Then I appreciate the retail exposure in the commercial real estate book. Just curious, is there any additional retail exposure in the specialty finance book, and what’s the health and characteristics of those borrowers, if there is any?   Thomas Cangemi   I would say we have a handful of maybe some grocers, household name grocers that have been very successful. Of course, their business is booming right now, so they’ve been drawing down on their facility, but I would say for the most part the specialty finance group has been performing. It’s stellar performance - you know, we haven’t had a delinquency since we’ve been in the business, and as far as our ratings, we’re very comfortable with all the credits we have. We’re very selective. We always talked about that, that what we see, 96% or 90% of it, we decline [indiscernible] you know, so we have large relationships - Amazon, Intel, paper, some very big large household names, but we’re not the lead bank. We participate in where we feel there’s low risk, and again this is not a high yielding portfolio but it’s a low risk portfolio, and it’s sup-senior secured.  I would say on a deferral perspective, you’re probably looking at maybe $200 million of deferrals on auto, but we think that the auto sector will be fine this year, and by the end of the year that stuff will go off of deferral and they’ll be back in business. And by the way, all these clients in auto have access to PPP and they’ve all been funded, so we feel pretty good about that.   Matthew Breese   Okay. Last one just on capital, how comfortable are you operating at these levels, especially as New York City is the epicenter and economic conditions do remain uncertain?   Thomas Cangemi   Again I would say very comfortable. Obviously we’re going to earn more money this year, assuming that credit holds itself. We’ve taken a sizeable provision for COVID-19. Absent COVID-19, we talked about CECL, we didn’t’ expect to have any real provision in the quarter other than the transitional adjustment, so we think that our portfolio performed very well in this environment.  We are not a C&I lender. We do have tenants that--landlords that have tenants that have retail and they have to work that out, but given the deferral program, we think that as they open up the city, as they open up America, we should be in a good place.   Matthew Breese   Got it. Great, that’s all I had. I appreciate you taking my questions.   Thomas Cangemi   You got it, Matt.   Operator   Our final question is from Ken Zerbe with Morgan Stanley. Please proceed.   Ken Zerbe   Good morning. Just in terms of the margin, I guess I’m a little surprised that you don’t get more benefit, sort of near term, and it sounds like you get, as you said, double digit NIM expansion every quarter over the course of the year. Can you just talk about why it’s, I’m going to say so consistent over the course of the year? Is it just because of how your deposits are re-pricing?   Thomas Cangemi   Rates are zero, close to zero, so pretty much the entire liability side of the balance sheet is getting close to zero, so that’s the major driver. At the same time, we do have lots of loans coming due and we’re not getting bleed on the loan yields going forward, and the coupons are reasonable, they’re not spiking. But if you take the cost of funds close to zero, and pretty much all of our--most of our retail funding is tied to short term funds, right, so like I said, $6 billion plus this quarter is at 2.35, and there’s really no high cost opportunity in the marketplace. We don’t envision customers leaving the bank to go somewhere else.  That being said, we still have the ability to borrow funds that are close to zero, so I think that the funding cost is clearly driving this opportunity and at the same time, asset yields are holding up very nicely, so you’re going to have, like I said, double digit margin growth in the second quarter. We envision that happening in Q3 and Q4 as well. We talked about Q1 being up two basis points - we hit our guidance. The pandemic hit towards the middle of March, and the Fed starting cutting interest rates. We actively cut interest rates, and we’re going to see that benefit going right into Q2.  Again, we don’t know where the market is going to end up on short term funds, but given that where the country’s position is, my guess is that rates are going to stay relatively low in 2020. Most customers are not going to go past one year to restructure their CD portfolio. As we continue to build savings accounts and non-operating accounts, that will also benefit a very stable cost of funds for the bank.   Ken Zerbe   Got it, but in terms of the timing--   Thomas Cangemi   Ken, I just want to go back. Just remember, we have five years of not seeing NII growth. We were positioned at the lowest returns this bank has experienced, so we’re in a upward trajectory, both the EPS growth and margin expansion. This will continue into 2021. We do not have the crystal ball what’s going to happen in 2021, and we’re talking about margin expansion here, but we think the margin bottomed out in the fourth quarter of 2019, we saw that inflection point that’s going to continue to significantly because of the Fed action. At the same time. the business model is getting a much higher spread than we’re accustomed to. When the competition is robust, Fannie, Freddie, CMBS, the whole world looking to get into the space, you’re 110 to 150 spread, right? So then we raised that to 200 after the rent laws changed, now we’re north of 300, so that’s a very healthy spread.   Ken Zerbe   Got it. Back in terms of the timing, though, do you have just as much re-pricing in second quarter, down a couple hundred basis points, as you do in, say fourth quarter?   Thomas Cangemi   Yes, second quarter on the CD side, just under $5 billion, and that’s at 2.06. So it’s continuing, so you’re going to get the benefit from the re-pricing in Q2 going to Q3, and more benefit in Q3 as well. That continues throughout the whole year [indiscernible] on return on average tangible assets, you’ll see a very unique growth in earning story and growth in margin story that could continue throughout 2021. We’re only talking to ’20 right now, it’s short visibility, but for the short term in the second quarter, margin expansion double digits.   Ken Zerbe   And is that margin expansion also premised on the view that your credit spreads stay above 300 basis points?   Thomas Cangemi   Yes, but again we have a 3.25 coupon coming on. It’s conservative. We have our pipeline, we’re feeding our pipeline through our model, right? The model is sophisticated. We just take the $2.1 billion pipe that we have, we have 64% new money, and that’s going on at 3.25. Now, new deals that we would offer you if you come to the bank tomorrow, you’re at 3.5 if you’re an A credit. If you’re a little less than A, you’re going to pay closer to 4.   Ken Zerbe   Got it, okay. Great, thank you.   Thomas Cangemi   Ken, pleasure.   Operator   We have reached the end of our question and answer session. I would like to turn the conference back over to management for closing remarks.   Joseph Ficalora   Thank you again for taking the time to join us this morning and for your interest in NYCB. We look forward to chatting with you again at the end of July when we will discuss our performance for the three months ended June 30, 2020. Thank you.   Operator   Thank you. This concludes today’s conference. You may disconnect your lines at this time, and thank you for your participation.	NotNews

Covid-19: Kerala worried as new cases pop up in green zones, prepares for return of expats  Between April 21 and April 27, the state saw 74 new Covid-19 cases added to its tally, taking by surprise doctors and health officials in war-rooms who had been keeping a watch on the situation.  29 Apr 2020, 10:22 by Vishnu Varma  A string of new infections in double digits in districts that had been declared Covid-19 -free has heightened worries among health officials in Kerala at a time when the state has been leading from the front in combating the pandemic .  Between April 12 and April 20, the state recorded only 34 new cases of coronavirus in a sign that the curve of new infections was beginning to stabilise. In those days, the number of patients who recovered from the infection each day remained consistently higher than new cases. But between April 21 and April 27, the state saw 74 new cases added to its tally, taking by surprise doctors and health officials in war-rooms who had been keeping a watch on the situation.     In fact, Kottayam district in central Kerala, which had the last of its coronavirus patients getting discharged in the first week of April, accounted for 17 of those new cases. The neighbouring hilly district of Idukki, which was also Covid-free by the second week of April, reported 14 cases. Both districts, plotted under ‘green zone’ had been enjoying the fruits of lockdown relaxations when they were swept by new cases of infection.  What’s especially worrying is that the state’s health department has been unsuccessful in pin-pointing the source of infection in at least 10 patients, deepening fears of a silent transmission of the virus within the community. A student from Panachikkad, a headload worker in Kottayam, two nurses hailing from Thiruvananthapuram and a businessman in Vaikkom town are among those where the source of infection hasn’t been proved yet. In addition, the state hasn’t been able to detect the source of the infection in the four-month-old girl from Manjeri or the 68-year-old man in Thiruvananthapuram, both of whom succumbed to the virus. But when asked about the same, Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan at his daily press briefing dismissed reports of ‘community transmission’, adding that the state hasn’t entered that stage yet.  ‘Virus doesn’t understand boundaries’  Dr Abraham Varghese, president of the Kerala chapter of the Indian Medical Association (IMA), said the state government’s decision to classify districts such as Kottayam and Idukki as green zones based on the number of infections and offer them immediate lockdown relaxations was not a sensible one. “The virus clearly doesn’t understand boundaries. When you classify a district as a green zone, you give the people there a false sense of confidence. They think they are safe and will rush out onto the roads. Such attitudes cannot be entertained,” said Dr Varghese.   Coronavirus Explained     What are human challenge trials, and why are they controversial?    In homemade masks, two fabrics better than one    Govt's guidelines for home isolation of mild and pre-symptomatic Covid-19 patients     Click here for more   “It’s like a mosquito net. If we end up leaving gaps in the corners, the mosquito will take advantage of the loophole to enter. The virus acts similarly. There cannot be any laxity on our part. We have been able to reduce the mortality rate because of social distancing and a stringent lockdown. Otherwise, the number of cases would have gone through the roof.”    Experts say Kerala cannot be complacent with the degree of progress it has achieved. (Source:: Kerala Govt PRD)   With the reporting of new cases this week, the government classified both Kottayam and Idukki as red zones where people can step out only for essential services. Four others – Kasaragod, Malappuram, Kannur and Kozhikode – are also in the red zone. Eight other districts are in orange zone where some relaxations have been offered for the public.  The Kerala branch of IMA agreed with the Kerala government’s contention that the national lockdown must not be lifted at once post May 3, but relaxed phase-by-phase. Restrictions must continue in the red zone districts and individual hotspots where clusters of cases are suspected. At the same time, to ease the economic pressure, relaxations on resuming certain kinds of businesses can be applied in other places. But, all social, political, religious and cultural gatherings must be banned. Inter-district and inter-state public transport will be suspended as well.  Asymptomatic cases on the rise  States like Maharashtra and Gujarat detecting the novel coronavirus in asymptomatic patients with greater frequency has made health officials in Kerala sit up and take note too. Though the official daily health bulletins in Kerala do not classify the active cases on the basis of symptoms or the lack of it, a source confirmed that a lot of infections in recent weeks have been detected in asymptomatic patients. When such patients cannot confirm a source of infection such as travel history or contact with a Covid-positive person, it becomes more complicated and dire. Fears of the virus having entered an exponential stage deepens at that point. But both chief minister and health minister KK Shailaja have repeatedly denied such a phenomenon.     Experts say Kerala cannot be complacent with the degree of progress it has achieved. It has to ramp up testing of samples, carry out extensive contact tracing and continue to implement stringent lockdown measures in vulnerable areas.  “The next stage of transmission has begun in Kerala where people coming from other states and foreign-imported cases are testing positive. The community spread is small at the moment, but it’s happening. Earlier, we were able to trace the source of infection in 98% of the cases. But now, it has reduced to 80%. So the gap is widening. We have to be more careful,” said Dr Padmanabha Shenoy, an immunologist and rheumatologist based in Kochi.  He added, “In a video on January 31, I had said that asymptomatic persons are going to be the challenge in controlling this disease. That’s why we are asking to increase the testing rate of samples. When people start arriving from other states and countries and as we move toward a community spread, we have to increase testing. Only when we test a large section of the population will we be able to gauge the problems we face.”    Doctors and other health staff lined up to give a farewell to one of the oldest couples to fight back COVID-19 at the Kottayam Medical College, Kerala.   States across India have expressed hurdles in ramping up testing, specifically due to the shortage of PCR testing kits. Kerala is no different either. In the initial days of the pandemic, Kerala’s testing rate per million was far ahead of the others. But soon, it was overtaken by states like Maharashtra, Gujarat, Delhi and Andhra Pradesh who subsequently reported a spurt in the number of cases, in connection with the Nizamuddin gathering. This week, CM Vijayan said the government has adequate stock of testing kits, procured in part through MPLAD funds of Congress MPs Shashi Tharoor and Hibi Eden, and plans to increase testing. On April 26, as opposed to the under 600 samples it tests on any given day, it sent over 3,000 samples as part of random testing. Available results of those samples showed 2,682 samples negative and just three testing positive.     The Kerala government is also hoping to get formal approval from the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) for the indigenous testing kit developed by a team of scientists and clinicians at the Sree Chitra Tirunal Institute for Medical Sciences and Technology (SCTIMST) in Thiruvananthapuram. The diagnostic test kit showed 100 per cent accuracy during trials at NiV, Alappuzha and matched with testing results conducted using RT-PCR. It can detect two regions of the gene, which will ensure that the test does not fail even if one region of the viral gene undergoes mutation during its current spread. The process of testing can be done in under two hours and the cost incurred for testing will be less than Rs 1000.  The iceberg phenomenon  Dr Abey Sushan, district programme manager with NHM in Pathanamthitta district, said all indications show that the coronavirus pandemic displays an ‘iceberg’ characteristic where clinicians and doctors can see the tip of the iceberg which represents the symptomatic and diagnosed cases. But the large submerged, hidden portion of the iceberg contitutes the asymptomatic, unrecognised portion of the disease among the population.  “This is actually the nature of the epidemic. There will be a large percentage of people who are asymptomatic and not being tested. There will be such people within the community…so first, we have to find all those people who are likely to test positive and isolate them. But however much we try to isolate, there will be some entropy. Some people are likely to fall out of the surveillance net because people move around a lot. These are inter-district or inter-state travellers such drivers of goods carriers. They are at high-risk,” he said.    At a hospital in Kerala. (PTI Photo/File)   “Our strategy in Pathanamthitta is to identify a lot of these people driving into the district with essential goods and then find people who may have had social interaction with them.”  So far, Kerala hasn’t entered the exponential phase of the pandemic where case numbers will double in 3-4 days, said Dr Sushan. But it is an eventuality for which the state needs to prepare.  “When we go into the phase, we will see overwhelming of the health system in districts where the machinery is not adequately prepared. In Pathanamthitta, we think the peak will come in mid-June to mid-July and we hope that it will be over by September,” he said.  Even in Japan, where social distancing is a norm and not a newly-acquired trend, the coronavirus has entered the expoential phase. India, in comparison, is a country where social interactions between people are much higher.  “The idea is to prepare the health system for such a phase. We are focusing on training the people and ensuring that infection control practices are being adhered to. So that when the exponential period sets in, we can be as prepared as we can be,” he said.  The inward flow of expatriates  Even as it continues to snuff out new infections in the state, the government’s toughest challenge is yet to come. Nearly three lakh Malayali expatriates, a majority of them from the Middle East, have registered themselves on a government website to come home when international flight operations to India will resume. That’s about 13% of the estimated 22 lakh Malayali expatriates settled around the globe.  For a severely-strained health machinery that has been working round-the-clock to tackle Covid-19, a huge flow of people into the state at a time like this is further strain on resources. But the chief minister has been clear about the government’s task at hand. “This is their home. This is where their families are. They have every right to come home. And when they do, we will be ready to arrange facilities for them,” he said at a press briefing this week.    DGP Lokanath Behera operating a drone in state capital Thiruvananthapuram to keep an eye on lockdown violators.   Though the Centre hasn’t given the green signal yet, Kerala has already begun to prepare the groundwork for facilities to quarantine a vast majority of them when they arrive. Instructions were passed to all district collectors to find such facilities. These include government and private hospitals, hostels, schools, hotels and lodges, resorts, Ayurveda retreat centres, auditoriums and stadiums. For those willing to pay for better facilities, such options will be available too.  But can the government afford to house everyone who arrives from abroad? That’s the major bone of contention. Doctors at IMA argue that foreign returnees must not be released into home quarantine as that could jeopardize the surveillance measures and foil the success the state has achieved till date.  Dr Varghese said, “Allowing them to go home is suicidal because they might go around visiting people. Their quarantine has to be institutional, for a period of 28 days. Also, everyone who comes in must be investigated, not just the symptomatic ones . Even if they are asymptomatic, they can turn out to test positive later.”  Dr Fazal Gafoor, president of the Muslim Education Society (MES) and a member of the Covid-19 task force constituted by the government, said the administration also faces a logistical dilemma in bringing these expatriates home.  “Even when you bring them home on flights, safe distancing has to be practiced. There has to be a minimum of 3-ft distance. Only two out of the six seats can be occupied. So on a 200-seater aircraft, you can bring only about 70-80 people at a time. Therefore, there’s the question of how many flights we will have to operate to bring thousands of these people home. It will take months,” he said.  The cost of air tickets will naturally go up as airlines will not only have to sell fewer seats but operate empty flights from the state to Gulf countries to bring them back, he added.  The government on its part has indicated that it will have to accord priority to those who have legitimate reasons to come home. These include pregnant women, handicapped persons, elderly people who need medical treatment, students, those on visiting visas and finally those who have lost their jobs and a place of residence. An extensive screening will be conducted at the airports therefore to prioritise among the travellers.  Dr Gafoor said there was a key difference in the attitudes of the Gulf states, where 2 million Malayalis live and work, and that of Kerala.  “Their attitude is that in case of an outbreak, people who contract the disease will be treated. But some people will die. So it can be dealt that way. That’s why we hear some complaints of people there who test positive being told to remain at home. But our attitude (in Kerala) is that we don’t want a single person to die.”  © IE Online Media Services Pvt Ltd	NotNews

Bills sign son of former Dolphins linebacker Bryan Cox  29 Apr 2020, 10:56 by JOHN WAWROW  BUFFALO, N.Y. (AP) — The Bills have signed defensive end Bryan Cox Jr., whose father never hid his dislike for Buffalo during his days playing for the AFC rival Miami Dolphins in the 1990s.  Cox Jr. was signed to a one-year contract Wednesday after splitting last season between Carolina and Cleveland. He has three seasons of NFL experience since being signed by the Panthers as an undrafted rookie free agent in 2017.  Overall, he has two starts in 25 career games.  Bryan Cox Sr. was a 12-year NFL linebacker and best known in Buffalo for antagonizing the Bills and their fans during his five seasons with the Dolphins.  Shortly before a game at Orchard Park in 1993, a television broadcast filmed Cox exiting the tunnel and directing his two middle fingers at the crowd, which led to him being fined by the NFL.  Cox told NBC his gesture was in response to batteries being thrown at him, and racist letters sent to him by Bills fans.  In the week before the game, Cox was quoted as saying: “I don’t like the Buffalo Bills as a team, I don’t like them as people, I don’t like the city, and I don’t like their organization.”  Two years later, in a game at Buffalo, Cox spit in the direction of Bills fans while being escorted off the field after being ejected for a fight with running back Carwell Gardner.  ___  More AP NFL: https://apnews.com/NFL and https://twitter.com/AP_NFL  JOHN WAWROW	NotNews
"Storms bring hurricane-force winds across 500 miles in south-central US. More severe weather is on the way.  29 Apr 2020, 19:12 by Doyle Rice, USA TODAY  More than 250,000 customers remained without power Wednesday due to an intense line of severe thunderstorms that rolled across the south-central U.S. overnight Tuesday.  The squall line sprawled across 500 miles and took aim at many major cities, including Houston, New Orleans, Dallas, Oklahoma City and St. Louis, AccuWeather said.  According to weather.com , the storm yielded more than 250 reports of severe weather in the 24 hours ending early Wednesday, from Illinois, Missouri and southeastern Kansas to parts of Texas and Louisiana. Most of those reports were for wind damage, strong thunderstorm winds or large hail.  Most of the power outages were in Texas and Louisiana, according to poweroutage.us .  The severe line of thunderstorms may have met the criteria for a derecho, AccuWeather said. Derechoes are often referred to as inland hurricanes due to the hurricanelike conditions, in terms of ferocious wind and torrential rain.  “The line of thunderstorms appears to have met the criteria for derecho with a steady concentration of high wind reports along a path of at least 240 miles,"" AccuWeather senior meteorologist Alex Sosnowski said.   More  :  Gustnado, derecho, and all the weird weather words you didn't know existed   Another round of severe weather was forecast for later Wednesday in the Southeast, with portions of Alabama, Georgia and much of the Florida Panhandle under the gun for damaging wind gusts, the Storm Prediction Center said. Montgomery, Alabama, and Atlanta were some of the bigger cities where severe storms were possible later Wednesday.  Although the severe weather threat will decrease on Thursday, heavy, drenching rain will be the main weather story in portions of the Mid-Atlantic and Northeast. Much of the region is under a flood watch due to the prediction of heavy rain.  While the South and East deal with wild weather, the Southwest continues to bake under a summerlike heat wave this week. Temperatures on Wednesday will be as much as 10 to 20 degrees above normal, the National Weather Service said, and that will allow some of the interior deserts of the Southwest to again exceed 100 degrees.

Netflix’s new series ‘Hollywood’ is another critical dud for Ryan Murphy, who could reportedly make up to $300 million from his overall deal  29 Apr 2020, 19:33 by Travis Clark, Business Insider US    Darren Criss in “Hollywood” Netflix    Ryan Murphy’s new Netflix limited series, “Hollywood,” debuts on Friday and has a “rotten” 46% Rotten Tomatoes critic score from early reviews.  His first Netflix series, “The Politician,” was also disliked by critics.  Murphy landed a deal with Netflix in 2018 worth as much as $300 million, according to The Hollywood Reporter.  Visit Business Insider’s homepage for more stories .   Superstar producer Ryan Murphy’s latest Netflix series, “Hollywood,” debuts on Friday and critics are slamming it in early reviews.  The limited series, about post-World War II Tinseltown, has a “rotten” 48% Rotten Tomatoes critic score based on 25 reviews.  Variety called it “the first outright dud of his post-‘Glee’ career.”  “The limited series gets so caught up in depicting the Hollywood of Ryan Murphy’s dreams – to be fair, of any progressive, equality-minded, film fan’s dreams – that it forgets to dig any deeper than the surface,” Indiewire ‘s Ben Travers wrote, adding that the series “proves an entertaining diversion, but it carries less weight than the smog hovering over Los Angeles.”  Murphy, who cocreated hits like “Glee” and “American Horror Story,” landed a deal in 2018 with Netflix worth as much as $300 million, according to The Hollywood Reporter . “Hollywood” is his second Netflix series for the streamer after “The Politician,” which debuted in September.  “Hollywood” is now Murphy’s worst-reviewed show since 2012’s “The New Normal,” which has a 55% critic score and was canceled after one season. It’s lower than “The Politician,” which has a “rotten” 57% critic score.  To be fair, “The Politician” has a positive 86% audience score, but it didn’t seem to make the kind of waves that past Murphy projects have made, nor did it generate the levels of excitement that recent Netflix hits like “The Witcher” or “Tiger King” have.  Next up, Murphy is developing a “One Flew Over the Cuckoo’s Nest” prequel series for Netflix starring Sarah Paulson as Nurse Ratched.	NotNews
California police are investigating a viral video showing an officer punching a 14-year-old on the ground  29 Apr 2020, 19:38 by Michelle Mark    Authorities in California are investigating after a video showed an officer punching a 14-year-old boy he was trying to arrest. Twitter/@SenKamalaHarris    California authorities have launched an investigation after a viral video showed a deputy punching a 14-year-old boy during an arrest.  The video triggered outrage at the level of force the officer used against the child. A number of elected officials, including as Sen. Kamala Harris, weighed in to call it a “horrific abuse of power.”  The Rancho Cordova Police Department and the Sacramento County Sheriff’s Office said in a statement that “it’s important to put video footage into context, especially in relation to a use of force incident.”  The statement said the deputy had seen a “hand-to-hand exchange between an adult and a juvenile,” and approached the boy, who was “uncooperative” and refused to be detained.  The 15-second video showed the white deputy struggling to handcuff the black teenager, then punching the boy several times before flipping him over on his stomach.

The 15-second video, which was tweeted out by lawmakers, including Sen. Kamala Harris of California, showed a white officer struggling to handcuff a black teenager, then punching the boy several times before flipping him over on his stomach.  Bystanders could be heard yelling “stop!” as the officer punched the boy.  The Rancho Cordova Police Department and the Sacramento County Sheriff’s Office said in a statement that the incident was under investigation, but added that “it’s important to put video footage into context, especially in relation to a use of force incident.”  The statement also suggested that the deputy resorted to force because the boy resisted.  “This type of situation is hard on everyone – the young man, who resisted arrest, and the officer, who would much rather have him cooperate,” the statement, by Sgt. Tess Deterding, said.     Deterding said the altercation occurred April 27 after the deputy saw “what he believed to be a hand-to-hand exchange between an adult and a juvenile.” The deputy approached and found the boy to be “uncooperative,” Deterding said.  “Having reasonable suspicion that criminal activity was occurring, the deputy attempted to detain the juvenile so he could conduct further investigation,” the statement said. “The juvenile became physically resistive at that time, causing the deputy to lose control of his handcuffs, which landed several feet away. The deputy attempted to maintain control of the juvenile without his handcuffs and while alone waiting for his partners to arrive and assist him.”  Deterding’s statement said the deputy later found tobacco products on the boy, “which is presumably the reason for his resistance.”  The boy was cited and released to his guardians, Deterding added.  The video triggered outrage at the level of force used against the child. Harris tweeted that the incident was “a horrific abuse of power. This officer must be held accountable.”  Julian Castro, the former secretary of Housing and Urban Development and ex-2020 Democratic candidate, also weighed in .  “This video of a @RanchoCordovaPD officer beating a 14-year-old is sickening, and demands immediate action,” he said. “How many of these videos must we see before we do something about police violence in this country?”	News
Related stories about sleep :  29 Apr 2020, 21:03 by MK Manoylov   Depression can cause insomnia, as it often leads to low sleep drive, poor circadian rhythm, and hyperarousal – which can make it difficult for you to fall asleep, stay asleep, or both.  Depression and insomnia are closely related and can form a vicious cycle, so you’ll likely need to treat both medical conditions – here’s how.  This article was medically reviewed by Alex Dimitriu, MD, psychiatrist and founder of Menlo Park Psychiatry and Sleep Medicine .  Visit Insider’s homepage for more stories .   Depression and insomnia often go hand-in-hand. That’s because depression can disrupt many aspects that help control our sleep-wake cycle.  This disruption can make it difficult to fall asleep, stay asleep, or both. Here’s what you need to know about how depression is related to insomnia and how to treat the combination of these medical conditions.  Can depression cause insomnia?  Depression can cause insomnia because of how it impacts the mechanics of sleep:  Low sleep drive  Depression commonly causes low energy levels and therefore decreased activity throughout the day. As a result, you may feel less sleepy at night.  “The things that promote good quality sleep are a lot of daytime activities keeping you busy and almost wearing yourself out throughout the day,” says Shannon O’Neill , PhD, an assistant professor of psychiatry at Mount Sinai.  For example, a 2008 study also found that 83% of people with depression had at least one insomnia symptom compared to the 36% of non-depressed people who showed insomnia symptoms.  Poor circadian rhythm  This is the body’s internal clock that coordinates sleep drive at night and wakefulness in the morning.  O’Neill says that depression can cause you to stay in bed too long in the morning, or take multiple naps in the day, which can disrupt your sleep routine and throw off your internal clock. In turn, this can lead to trouble falling asleep or staying asleep at night.  According to a 2008 study , about 66% of people who have major depressive episodes experience insomnia, with 40% of those people complaining about falling asleep, maintaining sleep, waking up too early, or all three.  Hyperarousal  Hyperarousal is this feeling of being alert – especially when you should be feeling sleepy. It can also mean the inability to fall quickly back asleep after an unexpected awakening.  This alertness may be the result of what’s called rumination – when you’re thinking about something long after it has passed. Depression can cause rumination, which can make it difficult to turn your mind off, especially when you’re lying awake at night. Anxiety may also be causing rumination and sleep troubles, though there is a key difference.  “If your mind is wandering to the past, that’s usually an indication that depression is seeping in,” O’Neill says. “If your mind is wandering to the future, that’s where anxiety lives.”  Insomnia and depression are closely related  Together, depression and insomnia create a vicious cycle, as both conditions further worsen symptoms for each other.  While depression can cause trouble sleeping, that lack of sleep can exacerbate irritability, low mood, and decreased energy levels or motivation.  To break this cycle, it’s important to address the root cause of your sleep troubles. If you feel that you have depression, you should talk with a therapist.  This can include a psychiatrist, psychologist, or mental health counselor – and there are many online therapy services you can use to schedule a virtual consultation.  The three most common therapies to treat depression include:   Cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) helps patients change negative thought patterns and behaviors that are associated with depression. One study found that 58% of depressed individuals who underwent CBT reduced their depressive symptoms.  Psychodynamic therapy helps patients resolve psychological harm or conflicts – typically rooted in childhood – that could contribute to depression. A 2017 study found that psychodynamic therapy can be just as effective as CBT for treating depression.  Interpersonal therapy focuses on how personal relationships can cause or exacerbate depression. Overall, research has found that there’s not much of a difference between the three therapies for treating depression, and aspects of each approach are all incorporated to mitigate depressive symptoms.   How to get better sleep with depression  However, insomnia often responds to intervention sooner than depression, and you may be able to resolve your sleep troubles before you can fully treat depression.  O’Neill recommends the following:  Get up around the same time each morning  This helps your circadian rhythm establish wakefulness in the morning and sleep drive at night.  O’Neill says that if it’s hard for someone with depression to get up in the morning, they may consider scheduling commitments early in the day that encourage them to get up and out.  Consistent wake-up times also help individuals feel energized in the morning, combatting the lethargy typically associated with depression.  Keep your bed for sleep  This will help your brain create an association between bed and sleep, prompting you to nod off more easily when laying in bed.  For example, you should complete schoolwork or watch TV outside of your bed, like at a desk, table, or couch.  The separation also motivates you to get out of bed and start the day, which is often difficult for people with depression.  Exercise and get outside  Research has found that regular exercise can improve sleep drive, making you feel more tired at the end of the day.  Activities that increase your heart rate, such as aerobics, powerlifting, and yoga can improve the quality of sleep and reduce insomnia, according to Johns Hopkins Medicine.  Exercising regularly can also reduce depressive symptoms, as it releases neurochemicals that boost feelings of well-being, helps build confidence, and offers a healthy way to cope with stress.  Create time to decompress before bed  This may be especially important if rumination is causing insomnia. O’Neill says this can be any calming bedtime ritual that primes the body to expect sleep, such as dimming the lights and reading a book, or taking a bath.  Make sure to avoid the blue light of electronics, or stressful activities like watching TV or reading the news, as this can have a stimulating effect.

Village Main Reef postpones potential job cuts until lockdown ends  SA imposed a strict 21-day lockdown on March 27, which was extended until May, to stop the spread of the new coronavirus, forcing most mines to temporarily shut down.  29 Apr 2020, 07:59 by Tanisha Heiberg, Reuters  Gold miner Village Main Reef, which planned a turnaround of its operations that could lead to job cuts, said on Wednesday it had agreed to postpone the retrenchment process until after the nationwide coronavirus lockdown.  The unlisted miner, controlled by China-based parent company Heaven Sent Gold, said it met with the mines minister earlier in April and agreed that the process would be halted until after the lockdown.  The National Union of Mineworkers (NUM), its majority union said last week up to 6 309 workers could lose their jobs at its Tau Lekoa mine, Kopanang mine and West Gold Plant.  “We were just starting to see positive signs of improvement in March, when unfortunately, the turnaround strategy was abruptly interrupted by the outbreak of Covid-19 in South Africa and the subsequent Lockdown (and its extension),” said Village Main Reef chief executive officer Jeff Dong.  Job cuts are a politically sensitive issue in South Africa, where unemployment stands at around 29%. The mining sector employs around 450 000 people, according to 2019 figures from the Mineral Council industry body.  South Africa imposed a strict 21-day lockdown on March 27, which was extended until May, to stop the spread of the new coronavirus, forcing most mines to temporarily shut down.  However, mindful of the economic damage caused by the shutdown of the sector, the government on April 16 said it would allow mines to start up again at up to 50% capacity.	News

China calls Australia 'gum on our shoe' for seeking coronavirus inquiry  29 Apr 2020, 07:58 by Richard Hartley-Parkinson  China today accused Australia of ‘petty tricks’ in a diplomatic spat over calls for an international inquiry into the coronavirus outbreak.  The argument, which led to China referring to Australia as chewing gum, could affect economic ties between the two countries. Prime Minister Scott Morrison said his proposed inquiry into how the coronavirus developed and spread would not be targeted at China, but was needed given Covid-19 had killed more than 200,000 people and shut down much of the global economy.  He said: ‘Now, it would seem entirely reasonable and sensible that the world would want to have an independent assessment of how this all occurred, so we can learn the lessons and prevent it from happening again.’  Chinese state media has fiercely rounded on Morrison, with Australian studies scholar Chen Hong writing in the Global Times tabloid on Wednesday that Australia was ‘spearheading’ a ‘malicious campaign to frame and incriminate China’.  Hu Xijin, the editor-in-chief of the paper which is affiliated to the Beijing-controlled People’s Daily newspaper, said on Chinese social media that Australia was always making trouble.

Australian government ministers have repeatedly said China, the country’s largest trade partner, was threatening ‘economic coercion’ after its ambassador, Cheng Jingye, said this week that Chinese consumers could boycott Australian products and universities because of the calls for the inquiry.  The head of Australia’s Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade (DFAT) called Cheng to express concern. The Chinese embassy then released a statement detailing what it said was discussed on the call, prompting another rebuke from DFAT.  On Wednesday, the Chinese embassy returned fire, saying on its website that details of the call had first been ‘obviously leaked by some Australian officials’ and it needed to set the record straight.    PM Scott Morrison wants an inquiry into the development and spread of coronavirus (Picture: AAP)   ‘The Embassy of China doesn’t play petty tricks, this is not our tradition. But if others do, we have to reciprocate,’ an embassy spokesman said in the statement.  New Zealand, which also has China as its largest trading partner, on Wednesday sided with neighbouring Australia in supporting an inquiry into the pandemic.  Deputy Prime Minister Winston Peters said: ‘It’s very hard to conceive of there not being a desire by every country in world, including the country of origin, for an investigation to find out how this happened.’  Australia’s call for an inquiry has so far only received lukewarm support more widely, with France and the United Kingdom saying it was not the right time to focus on an inquiry.  U.S. President Donald Trump has said China could have stopped the coronavirus before it swept the globe and that his administration was conducting ‘serious investigations’ into what happened.

"How to Ask for Help from a Distance  Princess Leia taught me 4 strategies that work.  29 Apr 2020 by Michelle Drouin Ph.D.  In Stars Wars Episode IV: A New Hope , Princess Leia delivers the iconic lines: “ This is our most desperate hour. Help me, Obi-Wan Kenobi. You’re my only hope .”  Princess Leia was not collocated with Obi-Wan or Luke Skywalker when this appeal was made. She wasn’t even live video-conferencing. This message—arguably one of the most compelling appeals in the history of film—was delivered via a recorded hologram from R2-D2’s mini projector.  Two things struck me as I watched this clip several times yesterday. First, I was surprised that hologram-based messages (from a 1977 movie) are not a standard form of communication technology today. [ Alexa , can you please help move this forward?] Second, I was shocked by how much Princess Leia’s message moved me. Immediately, I wanted to join Obi-Wan and Luke in their attempts to rescue Leia and restore justice to the galaxy.  This got me thinking: If Princess Leia can motivate a rebellion against the Empire, why do I sometimes have trouble getting people to respond to simple emails ? And if I am ever truly in need of help, either tangible (e. g ., monetary needs) or emotional, what can I do to increase my chances of getting the help I need ?    Source: lalesh aldarwish/Pexels   According to psychological research, some approaches work way better than others. In her appeal to Obi-Wan, Princess Leia used a few time-tested strategies that were key to getting others on her side. These strategies might be useful to all of us trying to get others to help us from a distance:   Pinpointing a single person to help. Calling on one person to help, as Leia did with Obi-Wan, may be one of the best ways to get people invested in your cause. When a general call for help goes out to the masses (e.g., “Can someone prepare that slide deck for the meeting tomorrow?”) a diffusion of responsibility among group members may result in no one stepping up. In contrast, calling out someone specific for help with a task (e.g., “Chris—Can you please prepare the slide deck?”) gives the target person ownership, responsibility, and agency. Chris is more likely to respond and assume responsibility for the task, and he may even feel a sense of self-esteem for being the one selected for the task.  Stating needs precisely . In the few lines before those iconic words, Princess Leia outlines exactly what Obi-Wan is supposed to do: deliver the R2 droid to her father in Alderaan; once there, Leia’s father will know how to access the information from the droid to save the Rebellion. There is no ambiguity in the message, no room for misinterpretation. Think about the following situation: Let’s say you’re reaching out to a friend because you’re taking care of a loved one and feel overburdened. Instead of saying “It would be great if you could help out,” perhaps pinpoint a specific need, like “Could you please prepare dinners for the next 3 nights and leave them at my house?” or “Could you call me each night for the next week, just to check in?” Clear, concise requests allow people to understand and fulfill expectations.  Conveying a message of hope. As Desmond Tutu said, “ Hope is being able to see that there is light despite all of the darkness. ” When trying to enlist others to come to your aid, you may want to use this idea of hope to motivate others to help. According to Chadwick (2015), hope appeals require two elements: a) getting others to feel hope by presenting them with an opportunity, and b) suggesting actions that will to allow them to take the opportunity and accomplish the intended goal. Princess Leia does this perfectly and actually uses the word “hope” in her final sentiment. However, even when the goal is not as lofty as restoring peace to the galaxy, helpers want to feel that their efforts are not going to waste and that they will be working towards a goal that aligns with their interests. So if you want people to join in the final push on a big project, try saying something like “We have only 5 more short reports to pull together, and this project is finished! Genni—can you take one and finish it by Wednesday?” This will help others see the light at the end of the tunnel.  Being direct and unequivocal. There is no question that Princess Leia needs help. She is clear. She says the words “help me,” and she doesn’t hedge with sentiments like “if you can,” or “if you have time.” The best way to ask for help is to reach out to someone and say “I need your help.” Unfortunately, many people may find it hard to reach out because they don’t want to be perceived as weak, or they may see some stigma attached to the help they are seeking (e.g., economic assistance) (Lens, Nugent, & Wimer, 2018). People also tend to underestimate (by as much as 50%) the likelihood of people saying “yes” to their direct requests, which led researchers Flynn and Lake (2008) to conclude, based on their series of six studies, “ If you need help, just ask .” The best way to let someone know you need help is to be direct. And although it may leave you feeling somewhat vulnerable, it leaves nothing open to interpretation.   All of this said, some people might still be wondering how to best frame their appeals for help and/or whether they should even ask for help at all. If you’re still debating, it’s important to recognize that the benefit of helping doesn’t flow only in one direction. Psychological research has helped us reframe the concept of help from a unidirectional positive influence from one person (the helper) to the other (the one who is helped) to a bidirectional one. Indeed, there seems to be benefit to the one giving in the form of a "" helper’s high ."" According to Dossey (2018) giving help to others might make you more in touch with the idea of the greater good and also might give you some health benefits, like lower levels of stress and depression and higher levels of happiness .  Princess Leia, ever wise, knew that if Obi-Wan helped her, it would help the galaxy, and she probably envisioned it helping him, too. Although (spoiler alert) it did not end well for Obi-Wan, if you reframe your requests for help as opportunities for others to shine, it can make asking for help a whole lot easier.

Three Things You Should Stop Doing This Week  Want to work a little less hard and getting more done while WFH? Here are three things to stop doing this week.  29 Apr 2020 by Scott Eblin  For many of us in the United States, week seven or so of the work from home (WFH) period is underway. And even as attention turns to how to get people back to the office, it’s pretty clear that we’re at the beginning of a pretty long haul of a lot more working from home than we ever thought we would. From my vantage point as a long-time work from homer and a coach to a lot of leaders and teams who are new to the scene, what I’m seeing is a slow realization that we’re in a marathon, not a sprint. And that means we’re going to have to adjust if we plan to finish the race on our feet.  About a month ago on the Pivot podcast with Kara Swisher and Scott Galloway , noted relationship counselor and therapist Esther Perel observed of the early days of WFH, “Never before have people worked so hard and gotten so little done.”  Inspired by Perel and what I’m seeing and hearing, here are three recommendations of things you need to stop doing this week if you want to work a little less hard and, in the process, actually get more done. If you’re in a leadership role, so much the better as whatever you stop doing will have a positive ripple effect for the people on your team.  Stop Sitting All Day – You probably never imagined you’d spend so much time at your kitchen table or that desk you set up in your extra bedroom. I have had way more than one client tell me that they’re sitting at their table in front of their screen for 10 or 12 hours a day without much of a break. I checked out some data from Fitbit today that showed the average step count for their users was down 12 percent the week of March 22 just as the WFH period was cranking up. I haven’t seen more recent data but am guessing the decline is now steeper and deeper. Sitting all day is bad for your health in general and bad for your brain in particular. You need fresh input to keep your neural network humming. Get up and out of your cave throughout the day. When you come back to the screen, you’ll feel better and think better.  Stop Making Every Meeting a Zoom Call – When the WFH period started, all the cool kids moved to Zoom. The barriers to entry were low and the value of seeing colleagues’ faces was high. The value is still there, but several weeks in, it looks we’ve all overcorrected on the use of  Zoom and other video conferencing platforms. The new notice is the emerging trend of Zoom fatigue. My colleague Beth Schumaker shared this article from National Geographic that explains what it is and why it happens. Here’s the summary. You’ve never been on stage before like you are on Zoom. In the Brady Bunch screen share mode , everyone can see everyone else’s micro expressions and you’re aware you’re being watched as carefully as you’re watching others. You might even be watching yourself as you speak which is not something you ever did pre-pandemic. It’s exhausting and leaves you depleted with less frontal brain lobe capacity to think strategically and make sound decisions. Zoom is great until it isn’t. Mix up your communications modalities. Take some old-fashioned phone calls a few times a day instead of another Zoom.  Stop Holding on to Your Original Plan – Going back to work won’t mean going back to normal. You’re not going to pick right back up with the strategic plans you laid out before the pandemic; you’ll have to continue to reprioritize and reimagine based on new realities. In spite of everything that’s already changed and all that clearly will change from this point forward, I’m hearing from clients that a lot of their colleagues are still pushing and grinding away on their original business plans for the year. I get that at some level – there’s comfort in the familiar and in the belief that by following a plan we’re in control of our outcomes. Well, in the words of Mike Tyson , “Everyone has a plan until they get punched in the mouth.” If you’re tempted to stick with your plan, acknowledge that you and everyone else in the world has just taken the mother of all left hooks to the jaw. If you’re still holding on to the original plan, let go of it, step back and ask, “What’s most needed and most important now?”  So, that’s my short list of three things to stop doing this week. What’s on your list?  — Published on April 29, 2020   You might also like...	NotNews
YouTube revenue jumps 33.5% in the midst of the Covid-19 pandemic  29 Apr 2020 by Bloomberg  Alphabet Inc shares surged after first-quarter results and upbeat executive comments showed the company’s cloud and YouTube businesses kept growing in the midst of the Covid-19 pandemic.  Sales came in at $33.71 billion, up 14% from a year ago and ahead of Wall Street estimates. YouTube revenue jumped 33.5%, while Google Cloud’s top line soared 52%.  “Results came out better than the market expected, with strong metrics in Google Cloud and YouTube,” Jason Bazinet, an analyst at Citigroup, wrote in a note to investors.  The world’s largest internet company has been trying to diversify away from search advertising for years by investing heavily in cloud services, digital video, consumer hardware and riskier long-term bets such as driverless cars.  The first quarter showed progress in several of these areas, even as Google’s main ad business suffered from virus-fueled cuts in marketing spending in March.  Chief executive officer Sundar Pichai said the cloud business was still strong, even if some deals were taking longer to complete. “We see overall momentum,” he told analysts during a conference call.  Chief financial officer Ruth Porat said YouTube brand advertising growth accelerated in the first two months of the quarter, but started to experience headwinds in the middle of March.  Direct response ads on YouTube, which often entice viewers into buying something, “continued to have substantial year-on-year growth throughout the entire quarter,” she added.  Alphabet shares jumped as much 9% in extended trading, putting them on course to wipe out big declines from earlier in the year.  “The quarter is essentially showing that Google is a diversified business positioned to be even more diversified on the other side of the pandemic,” said Jitendra Waral, an analyst at Bloomberg Intelligence.  “The cloud division is becoming the guardian of Google’s growth amid uncertainty around ads.”  Google’s massive cash pile, a pledge to continue share buybacks, and a major effort to rein in costs also buoyed the stock.  In an interview, Porat suggested the company’s services are being used more, which should help results in the future. “Given the usage trends we are seeing, we remain really optimistic about long-term trends,” she said.  The long-term opportunities include search, cloud computing, machine learning and consumer hardware, the CFO added, while noting the company is “looking at levers we have to moderate spending.”  Earlier this month, Pichai said the company would drastically slow hiring and cut its own marketing budget.  Google is not out of the woods, though. Porat told analysts that the company’s search and display ad revenue dropped more than 10% in March, versus a year earlier, as the virus and associated lockdowns tore into marketing budgets. The second quarter will be “difficult,” she added.  Ads still account for the vast majority of Alphabet revenue. Large clients like Expedia Group Inc. are slashing marketing costs. Google also sells a lot of ads to small businesses, thousands of which could shut as a deep recession sets in.  The internet company’s self-service ad platform can be switched off quickly.  Porat said people have been searching more on Google, but many of those queries were not commercial in nature, limiting the company’s ability to show ads. That was likely linked to a surge in people looking online for information about Covid-19.  The CFO said Google is seeing early signs of user behavior returning to normal, but stressed that it’s unclear how durable the trend is for now.  First-quarter net income was $6.84 billion, or $9.87 a share, versus $6.66 billion, or $9.50 a share, in the same period last year, the company reported.   Read:	News

"Samsung Electronics sees Q2 profit fall as virus hits sales of smartphones, TVs  Samsung said its first-quarter operating profit rose 3% in the January-March period, in line with an earlier estimate, as the stay-at-home trend due to the COVID-19 pandemic cushioned the virus blow.  29 Apr 2020 by Reuters  Samsung Electronics Co Ltd said on Wednesday it expected its profit to decline in the current quarter, as strength in the chip business would be offset by a sales slump in smartphones and TVs.  Samsung said its first-quarter operating profit rose 3% in the January-March period, in line with an earlier estimate, as the stay-at-home trend due to the COVID-19 pandemic cushioned the virus blow.  The South Korean tech conglomerate's chip business is benefiting from demand for servers and computers as stay-at-home orders force millions of people around the world to convert their homes into offices.  But sales of TVs and smartphones have slowed as recession-wary consumers postpone purchases of non-essential consumer electronics, a trend seen across the global tech industry.  ""Sales and profits of set products business, including smartphones and TVs, are expected to decline significantly as COVID-19 affects demand and leads to store and plant closures globally,"" Samsung said in a statement.  The world's top maker of memory chips and smartphones reported an operating profit of 6.4 trillion Korean won ($5.2 billion), compared with 6.2 trillion won a year ago and its earlier estimate of 6.4 trillion won.  It said net profit fell 3% to 4.9 trillion won, while revenue climbed 5.6% to 55.3 trillion won.  Samsung Electronics shares fell 0.8% in a flat wider market in morning trade on Wednesday. The shares are down 10% so far this year, in line with the wider market.

Address Potential Food Insecurity - NDPC Urges Govt  29 Apr 2020 by Peace FM Online     The National Development Planning Commission (NDPC) is advocating urgent measures to address any potential food insecurity in the midst of the COVID-19. In that regard, it has called for the establishment of efficient national, regional and local storage facilities and distribution systems geared towards preventing spoilage of food items. These were contained in a number of recommendations submitted to the government recently. The recommendations were contained in a document titled, “ Policy Response to job and welfare impacts of COVID 19: A focus on vulnerable groups.’’ Among others, the recommendations suggested guidelines towards addressing the job and welfare impacts of COVID-19 in the country. In the view of the NDPC, “ In all this, local government has a role to play. Local government should develop a strong collaboration with farmers and other agents in this direction, and the government policies on planting and rearing for food and jobs should be directed to boost the production of essential commodities, particularly, given the challenges associated with imports from other nations.” Subsidy Further recommendations were on the need for the government to subsidise personal protective equipment (PPE) in the efforts to fight the global pandemic. The commission, therefore, suggested that the government subsidise the cost of commodities such as the approved nose masks and sanitisers to enable the average poor households to buy them at lower prices to protect themselves. Financial institutions The NDPC also advocated the setting up of a national mobile money account to mobilise emergency funds from individuals and groups to minimise the burden on government’s revenue and scarce resources. The commission encouraged mobile network companies not to charge any fee on such transfers. In attempts to identify vulnerable workers, the commission also recommended that local government operatives should rely on market leaders in the various markets. “Also, government can rely on database at the various assemblies regarding store operators. Since these operators pay some levies, the assemblies will be in a good position to have the database regarding the degree of business diversity and vulnerability, as well as the contacts of associated workers/operators,” it added. Furthermore, the NDPC called on banks to give flexible and emergency loan facilities to average workers at a zero or minimal interest rate, with the government serving as the sole guarantor of those loans. Apart from that, the commission said banks should be encouraged to give a grace period to borrowers, particularly for the average earners who were currently servicing a loan. “This will enable such borrowers to save extra funds to cover essential commodities. That grace period may expire with the pandemic,” it added. Protection during crisis Giving further details, the NDPC said: “Ensuring social protection programme in this pandemic season will require reliable information and database for every worker, the unemployed, children, persons with disabilities and households.” It noted that Ghana like other developing nations was largely handicapped in that direction. “Nevertheless, in times of crisis, the government has no option but to develop strategies to minimise anticipated jobs and welfare shocks both at the present and post-pandemic periods,” it submitted. According to the NDPC, having a strategic policy response was even critical in times of a prolonged pandemic, which could result in a partial or complete nationwide lockdown. Private companies The commission also encouraged private companies to provide a loan facility and other incentives to workers who express interest but with a particular focus on those that are quite close to the national minimum wage threshold. “Religious leaders are encouraged to devise a strategy to provide in kind or cash transfer to the vulnerable members. This transfer programme, as much as possible, should be extended to other identifiable needy and vulnerable non-members in the community. “Beyond this, religious organisations should be motivated to provide other financial and non-financial support at the national, regional and local level in this fight,” the commission added. CSR The NDPC further called on the government to appeal to companies to extend their corporate social responsibility (CSR) in these times of the pandemic to cover more areas. “If possible, the government should appeal to both public and private workers who earn above a certain threshold to freely accept to donate a certain percentage of their monthly earnings to support vulnerable groups,” it said. It added that where possible, the government should provide incentives to public and civil servants who are below a certain threshold such as those who earn close to the daily minimum wage. Support programme The commission also called on the government to strengthen the current Livelihood Empowerment Against Poverty (LEAP) initiative. “If possible, the quantum of the transfer to designated poor households should be increased and possibly expanded in terms of coverage,” the commission added. It further said specific attention should be geared towards minimising the impact of the pandemic on rural economies and the northern part of Ghana because of “the evidence of high incidence of extreme poverty and vulnerability in those areas.” “It is recommended that the COVID-19 Welfare Committee should be set up for the purpose of communication, disbursement and distribution, monitoring and evaluation of various social protection programmes, proper documentation and data management for future policy formulation,” the commission said.

FF and FG tell the Greens they want to 'tease out' how 7% emissions reduction might be achieved  Responding in a letter to the Green Party, Martin and Varadkar make a number of commitments.  29 Apr 2020, 09:30 by Christina Finn  FIANNA FAIL AND Fine Gael has responded to the Green Party’s 17 questions stating that they are open to teasing out through talks how a 7% a year emissions reduction can be achieved.  In a response to the policy framework document, last week the Green Party called for a number of commitments before it would enter into government formation talks.  The party sought answers to a number of questions, such as will the next government commit to ending the issue of exploration licences for offshore gas exploration and cease the construction of new fossil fuel infrastructure, particularly LNG import terminals.  Responding to Green Party leader Eamon Ryan, the letter from Leo Varadkar and Micheál Martin stated that they wanted “to understand and tease out with you through talks, the specific actions that would have to be taken to achieve at least an average 7% a year reduction”.  Ryan has said such a reduction would be a red line issue for them entering government.  “We all need to understand the impact it would have on employment, poverty, agricultural practice, public transport, regional development and on the different sections of society,” stated the letter, adding that considerable work would have to be done to outline where and when further carbon reductions could or should come from given the economic situation and the need to “significantly reboot and revive the economy”.  “No party will want to introduce changes that will jeopardise employment or increase levels of poverty or have a negative impact on rural and regional development,” wrote Varadkar and Martin.  “We believe that within the first 100 days we should bring forward and enact a new Climate Bill that will enhance and strengthen the Climate Change Advisory Council,” they said.  On offshore gas exploration, Martin and Varadkar said both parties are open to a similar policy ban to onshore exploration for offshore gas exploration. The Greens called for the ceasing of LNG terminal construction also.  The Shannon Liquefied Natural Gas (LNG) terminal has come under the spotlight in recent months after criticism of the project intensified over its proposed use of fracked gas. The proposed energy project in Kerry made headlines after pop icon Cher became the latest celebrity to call on the government not to back it.  “Both of our parties accept that as we move towards carbon neutrality, it does not make sense to build new large-scale fossil fuel infrastructure such as liquid natural gas import terminals,” said the letter. It adds that while additional security of gas supply could be beneficial, there is a secure supply at present from the Corrib Gas Field and the United Kingdom.  The letter states that there is a need to have a shared understanding of what is meant by new fossil fuel infrastructure, what type scale does this relate to, and whether this proposed ban would apply to State infrastructure or to private sector infrastructure as well.   Ending Direct Provision   Fianna Fáil and Fine Gael has also committed to a comprehensive deep retrofit scheme as part of a programme for government. It has also committed to working towards ending the Direct Provision system.  “This will take time, but both of our parties are committed to achieving the standards set out in the McMahon Report such as own-door and self-catering accommodation and we need to be conscious of other priorities within the housing sector also. We can discuss this further when we meet,” stated the letter.  On transport, the letter from the party leaders stated that their parties are committed t increasing the number of daily journeys by foot and bicycle, as well as investing more in public transport.  We do commit to increasing capital expenditure in walking and cycling areas and we want to discuss the best way that this should be done taking into consideration the pipeline and quality of projects.  We can commit to ensuring that in terms of new transport infrastructure, a 2:1 ratio of expenditure for public transport to roads is achieved.  Fine Gael and Fianna Fáil are also willing to discuss Universal Basis Income as part of the Programme for Government talks. They also commit to reviewing the State’s response to the COVID-19 Emergency to learn lessons for the future in the framework document.  Outlining how some of the framework document’s promises might be achieved, Martin and Varadkar state in the letter that the document “is a starting point for discussion not an end point.  “Nobody knows with any reasonable degree of accuracy how long the COVID-19 Emergency will last, how slow, or fast the recovery will be or what form of Brexit will take place in 2021,” states the letter, but goes on to state a number of ways Ireland intends to pay, such as by borrowing.  In conclusion, the letter to Ryan states:  At a time of genuine crisis, we welcome the fact that the Green Party is giving serious consideration to taking part in Programme for Government talks.  We believe that working together we could implement many transformative policy changes across many areas. As mentioned earlier direct discussion between our parties would allow us to tease out any issues arising from the recent letters and the Framework document and hopefully enable us to move to Programme for Government talks.  #Open journalism No news is bad news Support The Journal  Your contributions will help us continue to deliver the stories that are important to you   Support us now	NotNews
Diplomacy is another victim of the virus  29 Apr 2020, 09:26 by Mihir Sharma    Chinese Foreign Ministry new spokesman Zhao Lijian gestures as he speaks during a daily briefing at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs office in Beijing. From Asia to Africa, London to Berlin, Chinese envoys have set off diplomatic firestorms with a combative defense whenever their country is accused of not acting quickly enough to stem the spread of the coronavirus pandemic. | AP   New Delhi – It is always a good feeling when you spot talent early. That’s how some of us in India feel now that Zhao Lijian, the spokesperson of China’s foreign ministry, has become a global star. Zhao’s briefings have grown sharp, pugnacious and newsworthy as criticism of Beijing’s response to the virus has risen around the world. He single-handedly set off weeks of acrimonious debate by speculating on Twitter that it might have been the “U.S. army who brought the epidemic to Wuhan.”  We in India noticed Zhao a while ago, when he was a junior diplomat in Islamabad. He distinguished himself in that posting, honing skills that are becoming an indispensable part of the new-age diplomatic arsenal: misdirection, misinformation and social-media aggression. Zhao collected hundreds of thousands of Twitter followers along the way, as well as a promotion. Across the world, scores of “wolf warrior” Chinese diplomats — named after a blockbuster set of films about an elite Chinese commando unit — have followed Zhao’s example, setting up Twitter accounts that attack their hosts, clap back at negative stories in the press and sometimes promote fringe conspiracy theories.  It’s easy to think of this brash behavior as something characteristic to the Xi Jinping-era Chinese state, which seeks in every domain to reflect the new assertiveness underlying the Chinese president’s “four confidences” doctrine. But China’s young diplomats aren’t unique; the U.S. State Department has pointed out that “disinformation narratives” from Iran, Russia and China on the coronavirus have “converged.” And, as effective as Zhao is on Twitter, he has yet to approach the grandmaster-level trolling of the Russian Embassy in London.  Is there a point to this aggressiveness? Some older Chinese diplomats sound appalled by the wolf-warrior approach. But they aren’t the audience. Neither is global public opinion. For diplomats like Zhao, the real goal is to win the approbation of your superiors — and, importantly, a devoted following of hyper-nationalists at home.  For centuries, a key job of diplomats abroad was to moderate and translate the snarls of the xenophobic mobs back home. Today, a country’s emissaries are rewarded if they amplify nationalist growling. Those who hew to the hardest line become heroes and those who do their traditional job are condemned. Zhao, when he returned to Beijing after his Islamabad posting, was cheered into his new office by a group of admirers.  The fact is that nobody really knows how to conduct old-style diplomacy in the age of social media, when the people you supposedly represent and those you are trying to placate can insult each other freely on Twitter 24 hours a day.  India’s diplomats in the Gulf monarchies, for example, are in particular difficulties at the moment. Skewed reporting about the pandemic has set off a wave of Islamophobia in India, online and off, which has alienated some in the normally India-friendly Gulf elite. India’s diplomats in the region have been caught in the middle, desperately trying to assuage local anger while avoiding saying anything that might be inconvenient for their political masters back home.  And then there’s the United States, which has a very specific and high-level problem, namely its president. U.S. President Donald Trump’s ability to redirect, contradict or just confuse U.S. foreign policy aims through a single tweet is nothing short of awe-inspiring.  And it is worth remembering that the problem will not go away with Trump. Every diplomat in the world should be worried about a boss with access to a Twitter account. Even the inoffensive Canadians managed to start a Twitter war, remember? Foreign Minister Chrystia Freeland sent out a tweet asking Saudi Arabia to release a women’s-rights activist, and the Saudis cancelled flights, recalled their ambassador and started selling Canadian assets.  Many assumed that social media would strengthen diplomacy by giving leaders like Trump more power to directly negotiate and manage narratives — that “top-down” diplomacy would replace “dialogue-based models.” But, in diplomacy as elsewhere, radically democratizing a previously closed space hasn’t necessarily improved matters. Like politicians and journalists, diplomats are now encouraged to react to the angriest and loudest voices they hear. They feel accountable to them — and are, perhaps, a little scared of them.  Instead of being the adults who foster dialogue, who can see both points of view while arguing for one, diplomats are being transformed into megaphones for narratives that are already loud enough to be heard across continents. In the process they are in danger of rendering themselves redundant. The “wolf warriors” may well tell us something about today’s China. But what they tell us about the future of diplomacy is just as disturbing.  Mihir Sharma is a Bloomberg Opinion columnist.

"Boniface Mwangi Confronts Police During Dubious Arrest [VIDEO]  29 Apr 2020, 09:09 by Eddy Mwanza   Footage of activist and photojournalist Boniface Mwangi confronting plainclothes police officers surfaced online on  Wednesday, April 29.   Speaking to Kenyans.co.ke the Ukweli Party leader revealed that the incident involving the arrest of 4 men in Korogocho happened during a raid in which the police claimed to have apprehended them for failing to wear protective masks.  However, in the video, Mwangi questioned the validity of the arrest, going further to confront one of the officers whose face mask was strapped to his chin, a clear breach of how to properly wear the mask.  ""You aren't even wearing your mask, do you think what you are doing is just?"" Mwangi asked the arresting officer.     Children and residents in the slum area crowded around the officers while chanting 'this is not justice'.  On his part, the officer clad in a printed t-shirt, brown jacket and black pants maintained that the suspects were in clear violation of the mask rule.  ""We found them without their masks on and we are here to enforce the law,"" he insisted.  Quizzed on whether it would make more sense to go after thugs and criminals known for villainous acts in the area, the officer claimed that one of the suspects was under arrest for a separate offence.  Upon arriving at the Korogocho Police Post, he further revealed that one of the suspects had been nabbed at a chang'aa den.  However, Mwangi questioned why the bar owner was not among the arrested suspects.  ""If you really found him at a bar, how comes the bar owner is not here. Was he at the bar by himself?"" he asked.  The officer simply ignored the question and went ahead to process the suspects, who were all in face masks.  One officer stationed at the precincts entry area took a quick temperature check of the suspects as well as Mwangi and his crew before they were allowed in.  On April 15, Inspector-General of Police Hillary Mutyambai, announced that the grace period for adjusting to regulations handed down by President Uhuru Kenyatta regarding taking prescribed precautionary measures to combat the spread of Covid-19 had expired.  He further announced that any violators would be arrested and taken to court.  “A person who commits an offence under these rules shall, on conviction, be liable to a fine not exceeding Kshh20,000 or imprisonment for a period not exceeding six months or both,” he announced.  On March 31, the Independent Policing Oversight Authority (IPOA), issued a statement stating that three deaths allegedly caused by police enforcing the dusk-to-dawn curfew had been registered for investigation.

USD/CNH could move below the 7.0650 level – UOB  29 Apr 2020, 09:54 by Pablo Piovano  FX Strategists at UOB Group noted the bearish view on USD/CNH and believe it could recede to the 7.0650 level and below.  Key Quotes  24-hour view: “Instead of trading sideways, USD dipped to 7.0759 before recovering. The underlying tone has weakened and from here, a break of the 7.0759 low could lead to further USD weakness to 7.0650. Resistance is at 7.0880 followed by 7.0920.”  Next 1-3 weeks: “The rebound in USD from a low of 7.0370 (Apr 10) touched 7.1087 on 21 Apr and since then, it has not been able to make much headway on the upside. The price action is not out of line from our expectation from 16 Apr (spot at 7.0770) wherein USD ‘has likely moved into a consolidation phase’ and ‘is likely to trade between 7.0450 and 7.1250 for a period’. That said, the underlying tone has weakened and the downside risk is beginning to increase. From here, unless USD can move above 7.1030 within these few days, a break of 7.0650 would improve the prospect of USD moving below 7.0370.”	News
Zoom rival, Google Meet, now adding 3 million users per day  29 Apr 2020, 09:42 by Tech Desk  Video conferencing websites are flourishing following the coronavirus lockdown as the new way of communication.  Cashing in on this opportunity is Google’s Meet; a video conferencing service that is adding about three million users per day says Sundar Pichai, CEO of the company, reports Forbes .  Meet, which is available only to schools, businesses, and governments is distinct from the consumer-focused Hangouts tool.  Pichai reported that the video conferencing service has about 100 million active participants per day, which represents about a 300 per cent growth in usage since January.  The video conferencing services offers a layout displaying up to 16 call participants at once, resembling a popular option on rival Zoom.     At present, the search engine giant is not charging customers for upgrades to Meet-related features like large video calls during a six-month period ending in September.  In addition to this, the company also unlocked premium Meet features to all G Suite users, amid the Covid-19 pandemic.  Despite this Google faces tough competition from its rival Zoom, which has over 200 million daily active users and growing.  Google plans to merge its popular Hangout product for consumers with Meet alongside introducing improved video quality in dim lighting and filtering of background noise, such as keyboard clicks and slamming doors.     Even though Zoom is marketed being marketed as a B2B video conferencing solution it is being used worldwide to host fitness and yoga classes, celebrate birthdays and even throw karaoke parties in times of social distancing.

Coronavirus latest: Vuelta a Espana cancels departure in Holland  The Vuelta a Espana has cancelled plans to stage this year’s departure in Holland because of the “exceptional worldwide situation” caused by the coronavirus pandemic.   29 Apr 2020, 09:53   Utrecht was due to host the start of the race, the dates of which are as yet unknown because of the reshuffling of the cycling calendar although an announcement from the UCI could come later on Wednesday.  While Vuelta organisers are still hopeful of the event going ahead, after the World Championships and potentially as late as November according to some reports, they will now be searching for a new route.     “The departure of La Vuelta 20 from Holland was a project that had been designed as a big summer party,” La Vuelta Holanda said in a statement.  “Faced with the impossibility of ensuring the planned development of the race’s official departure, with all of the required guarantees for an event of these characteristics, La Vuelta Holanda has preferred to request the official departure’s cancellation.”  The Vuelta was originally scheduled to take place between August 14 and September 6 but the UCI announced earlier this month it would have to be rescheduled for later in the autumn after the Tour de France was rearranged.  Moving three stages, on three days, through 34 municipalities with start and finish places in various places turned out to be a bridge too far Martijn van Hulsteijn  With the Dutch government forbidding the celebration of sporting events until September 1, organisers on both sides say they have been unable to find a new date in which to launch from the regions of Utrecht and North Brabant.  La Vuelta Holanda director Martijn van Hulsteijn said: “Moving three stages, on three days, through 34 municipalities with start and finish places in various places turned out to be a bridge too far.  “For example, we did not have all the needed infrastructures at our disposal. In addition, a lot of road works were carried out around the 34 participating municipalities in the autumn.  “The impact would be too great. Even if you leave the desirability and uncertainty in Corona time out of the discussion.”    Primoz Roglic won the 2019 Vuelta (Bradley Collyer/PA)   Race director Javier Guillen added: “The change to the calendar resulted in a modification of the original program.  “We discussed this with our Dutch partners, with whom we have worked in absolute harmony and in complete collaboration.  “We realised that it would be impossible to carry out this project under these new constraints.  “It is a complicated decision, one you never want to make, but which we have found ourselves compelled to do due to the complex circumstances we are currently living, which surpass any foreseeable expectation.”  ID:397928:	News
Russia's coronavirus case tally nears the 100,000 milestone   29 Apr 2020, 09:35   MOSCOW (Reuters) - Russia’s nationwide tally of confirmed coronavirus cases neared the 100,000 mark on Wednesday after 5,841 new cases of the virus were registered overnight along with a record daily rise in the death toll.  Russia, the world’s largest country by territory, has been on lockdown since President Vladimir Putin announced the closure of most public spaces in late March.  It this week overtook China and Iran in the number of confirmed cases. The figures mean Russia now ranks eighth worldwide for the number of confirmed cases, though it has so far recorded far fewer deaths than many of the most hard-hit countries.  The nationwide case tally now stands at 99,399, the country’s coronavirus crisis response centre said on Wednesday. It said 108 people diagnosed with the novel coronavirus had died in the last 24 hours, a record daily rise. That means the official overall death toll now stands at 972 people.  Authorities began recording a sharp rise in cases this month.  Russia is now in its fifth week of a lockdown that, together with the collapse of oil prices, has put the economy on course for a 4-6% contraction, according to the central bank.  Putin, addressing the nation on television on Tuesday, said the lockdown measures would have to be rolled over for another two weeks. He warned the outbreak’s peak was still ahead.  “The situation is still very difficult,” said Putin. “We are facing a new and perhaps the most intense stage in countering the epidemic.”  Reporting by Gleb Stolyarov and Maria Kiselyova; Writing by Tom Balmforth; Editing by Andrew Osborn	News

I went freelance so my wife and I could juggle career with childcare even before the coronavirus — here's how I am rising to the new challenges  29 Apr 2020, 09:36 by Brianna Moné   Back in 2016, I traded in an hour-plus commute for a remote lifestyle as a freelance journalist.  Though I was already used to working from home, the coronavirus pandemic introduced a new wrinkle with school closings.  Many of the rules still apply, however, such as staying organized, putting up barriers (like a change of clothes!) between your work life and your personal life, and maintaining a manageable workload.  Visit Business Insider’s homepage for more stories .   People around the world have been getting used to working from home after weeks in lockdown, but this has been my lifestyle for the past four years.  I made the switch from an hour-and-a-half commute into London to a brief stroll into the study of my Hertfordshire (UK) home in 2016 to make it easier for my wife and I to both work and cope with rising childcare costs and school drop-offs.  This meant I wasn’t too concerned when employees were advised in March to work from home to keep the coronavirus outbreak under control. I haven’t visited an office, aside from the occasional meeting, in years.  Some occupations – such as a construction worker or a healthcare professional – cannot necessarily be done at home, but most journalists nowadays really need only a computer, a notepad, a phone, an internet connection, and a strong sense of skepticism.  The school closings during lockdown have created an extra logistical test, but it is amazing how the stomping and shouting of our 5- and 7-year-old girls can soon emulate the rowdiness of a newsroom.  It is not always easy and takes a lot of patience, self-motivation, and teamwork with my wife, but here is how I find the balance between freelancing and being a father.  Forget the 9-to-5  We seem to be hardwired that the working day must take place between 9 a.m. and 5 p.m. Before lockdown, commuters crowded public transport in rush hour in fear of being late. But by the time you arrive, get a coffee, and catch up with colleagues, you may not really be ready to start until 9:30 or even 10 a.m. – so why is everyone rushing?  You may find your most creative and inspired moments are earlier in the day or even later. As long as I met deadlines, this gave me time to do school pickups and drop-offs pre-lockdown without any guilt of being away from my desk. Nowadays it means I can spend quality time with my family and do our allocated daily exercise. Often the best ideas will also come when you are away from your desk.    Foto: The author in his workspace. Source: Marc Shoffman   This is all the more important for families in which both parents are working and homeschooling. Our children are sent a timetable from their teachers to follow each day, and the same should go for your work. My wife and I alternate so one of us can teach and the other works at the same time, and we tick off what we have covered as we go.  Make a to-do list with reasonable expectations for your working day, but don’t worry if it isn’t completed as long as the most important tasks are prioritized. Even ticking off simple tasks such as sending a specific email can give you motivation. The online organization tool Trello can help prioritize your workload and inform others of your progress.  Professional versus personal  We have told our daughters they still need to wear their school uniform during homeschooling. They may not be too pleased with the Shoffman school rule, but I find it helps them focus as it differentiates between work and play.  The same is true with working from home. You don’t need to wear a suit, but getting out of your pajamas will switch your mentality from pillows to productivity. Shoes are optional.  Create a dedicated work area, even if it is just somewhere you regularly sit at the dining table or the couch, so you have the feeling of traveling to work. Some recommend walking around the block each morning as if you are commuting. Our spare room is my office, but it is good to occasionally have a change of scenery if you are lacking inspiration.  Don’t do housework  You wouldn’t get up to empty the dishwasher or put on a load of washing while working in an office. It shouldn’t be any different when you are at home and following your schedule. Don’t let household chores disrupt your working day.  Network  Working from home can be lonely, as there are no colleagues to have a quick chat with. Find professional bodies or networking groups to attend events or make an effort to meet with old colleagues regularly. This is good for your mental health and useful for picking up ideas and more work. It is harder to meet for a drink nowadays, but there is nothing to stop Zoom or Houseparty catchups or a phone call.  Find your niche  Freelancing has meant I can be more flexible about what I do, but finding a specialty makes it easier to source work. I focus on writing about personal finance, and there are plenty of blogs, industry newsletters, forums, Twitter lists, and Facebook and Slack groups where you can get ideas and discuss opportunities.  Take time to develop your professional skills to keep up with your industry’s trends. As well as writing, I also record a weekly personal-finance podcast in the evenings called “In for a Penny.”    Foto: Source: Marc Shoffman   Family comes first  There will always be deadlines, but you don’t want your children to remember you for how much work you did. They will treasure the time you spent with them, not working around them.  Don’t be afraid to say no to jobs. This will keep your workload manageable and achievable and ensure you still have some free time from freelancing.	NotNews

From U2 tickets to cigars from Cuba: The weird and wonderful gifts given to MPs   29 Apr 2020, 08:34   New records show Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern and Opposition leader Simon Bridges have been gifted free U2 concert tickets, while Deputy Prime Minister Winston Peters was gifted cigars by the Cuban Ambassador.  The 2020 Register of Pecuniary and Other Specified Interests was released on Wednesday, containing a summary of the assets, debts and gifts New Zealand MPs have received as at January 31, 2020.  The list shows how the Prime Minister has been showered with gifts, including a porcelain dish displayed at Premier House gifted by French President Emmanuel Macron, and a hand-carved frieze in frame gifted by His Majesty King Abdullah II of Jordan.  Ardern was also given a lifetime subscription to TIME magazine, as well as Elton John tickets, U2 tickets from lead singer Bono, and tickets to an All Blacks vs Australia game donated by New Zealand Rugby.  The Prime Minister was also given a framed and signed photograph of Their Royal Highnesses The Prince of Wales and The Duchess of Cornwall.  Both Ardern and Peters were given gifts from the Ambassador of Cuba to New Zealand. Ardern was given a gift basket while Peters was shouted a box of Cohiba Behike cigars.  Peters was also gifted an ornamental small combarbalite box from the Government of Chile.  The Auckland Racing Club donated season passes to the Ellerslie races, which the records note have not yet been used by Peters. In addition, the New Zealand First leader got a Qantas Chairman Lounge membership.

The National leader also received two free Bledisloe Cup tickets thanks to New Zealand Rugby.  House Speaker Trevor Mallard also got a fair share of gifts, including Halberg Awards tickets donated by Sky TV, match tickets and hospitality from Wellington Rugby, and FIFA Women’s World Cup tickets from New Zealand Football.  Mallard also got free Warriors rugby tickets, All Blacks and Black Ferns tickets and hospitality, tickets to witness the launch of Emirates Team New Zealand, Silver Fern test tickets and ASB Rugby Awards tickets with hospitality.  Grant Robertson, who is both the Minister of Finance and the Minister of Sport and Recreation, was the recipient of a number of sport-related gifts. Among what he received was four tickets to Rugby World Cup games from World Rugby and hospitality at the Cricket World Cup 2019 final.  He was also given a model of the golden gate at Hanoi's Temple of Literature, which was gifted from Hanoi People's Committee chairman Nguyen Duc Chung.  Minister of Civil Defence Peeni Henare - who it is noted was one of three MPs to submit their register of interests past the required deadline - received two tickets to a Warriors v Sharks game from National Rugby League Limited. He was also gifted a pounamu sculpture from Wai-Atamai and a manaia pounamu necklace from Te Rūnanga o Ngāi Tahu.  National MP Judith Collins received tickets to ASB tennis games, Warriors matches and an All Blacks vs Australia rugby game. She also received two jackets from Trelise Cooper.  A number of MPs received helicopter flights. Some rides were for conservation visits, and others were over mining operations or for high country station visits.  The full register consists of 14 categories of declarable interests, including property, superannuation schemes, overseas travel and payments received for activities.  Alongside recording members' interests, the register also aims to provide transparency and strengthen public trust and confidence in parliamentary processes and decision-making.	NotNews
USD/JPY Price Analysis: Slips further below 107.00 to refresh six-week low, bears eye sub-106.00 area  29 Apr 2020, 01:50 by Anil Panchal    USD/JPY remains pressured below 107.00.    A sustained break of 106.90, directs the sellers towards another horizontal support.    The monthly falling trend line adds to the upside barriers.    USD/JPY refreshes the six-week low while taking the offers near 106.50, down 0.33% on a day, during the early Wednesday’s trading session.  In doing so, the pair portrays the five-day losing streak while also extending the break below a horizontal line comprising early and mid-month lows near 106.90.  Also supporting the bears is the pair’s drop beneath 50% Fibonacci retracement level of February-March downside, which in-turn pushes them towards a horizontal line joining March 05 low and March 10 high around 105.95/90.  During the pair’s further downside below 105.90, 105.00 could lure the sellers.  Meanwhile, an upside clearance of 106.90 will have to cross the monthly resistance line, currently near 107.60, as well as cross 61.8% Fibonacci retracement level of 108.00 to recall the buyers.

"Football league announces kickoff times for opening weekend   29 Apr 2020, 01:50     (Yonhap)   The South Korean football league announced kickoff times and matchups for the upcoming opening weekend on Wednesday. The Korea Professional Football League (K League) said the official season opener for the K League 1 between Jeonbuk Hyundai Motors and Suwon Samsung Bluewings will begin at 7 p.m. on May 8. Jeonbuk are the three-time defending champions, and Suwon won the 2019 FA Cup. Jeonbuk will host the showdown at Jeonju World Cup Stadium in Jeonju, 240 kilometers south of Seoul. The league had announced last Friday that Jeonbuk and Suwon would meet to kick off the 2020 season, which was postponed from the original Feb. 29 start due to the coronavirus outbreak. It will be the only match on May 8. It will be followed the next day by three more matches, with the 2019 runners-up Ulsan Hyundai FC hosting Sangju Sangmu at 2 p.m. at Ulsan Munsu Football Stadium in Ulsan, 400 kilometers southeast of Seoul. It will be the K League return for former Premier League midfielder Lee Chung-yong. Gwangju FC, which got promoted from the K League 2, will play their first K League 1 match in three years on May 9 against Seongnam FC. There will be two more matches on May 10, with Busan IPark, having also earned a promotion from the second division, set to make a return to the top competition after five years away. The K League 1 will see 12 matches as part of its ""Friday Night Football"" series. The Jeonbuk-Suwon opener will be the first of the dozen. With the start of the season pushed back by more than two months, teams will each play 27 matches, down from 38 in a typical season. They will play 22 matches against one another first, and then the top six and the bottom six clubs will be split into ""Final A"" and ""Final B."" From that point, teams will each play five matches within their own group. Since there will be an odd number of games there, the league has decided to give teams with better records more games at home. The top three teams in each group will get three home matches, while the bottom three will get two matches at home. The early portion of the season will be played without fans in the stands. The league said it will wait for further loosening of government quarantine guidelines before making any decision on when fans will be allowed to come to matches. (Yonhap)"	News
"Coronavirus in Oklahoma: $20M sought from small-business relief fund  29 Apr 2020, 06:05 by William Crum   Related coverage      Applications for Oklahoma City's small-business relief fund show there is ""obviously … a need out there,"" an economic development leader told the city council Tuesday.  Cathy O'Connor, president and CEO of the Alliance for Economic Development of Oklahoma City, said businesses have applied for more than $20 million from the Oklahoma City Council’s $5.5 million Small Business Continuity Fund.  The council acted March 31 to fund COVID-19 business assistance from voter-approved 2017 economic development bonds.  Applications were due April 17. Awards approved by an eight-member disbursement committee could begin going out by the end of next week, O'Connor said.  ""We hope we can make a big difference for some of these small companies,"" she said.  The program includes cash incentives and forgivable loans. Qualifying businesses were required to demonstrate a loss of at least half their business, year-over-year, since March 16, and show they receive most of their revenue from in-store sales.  Goals include prioritizing businesses in operation at least a year, with at least 25% of funding directed to low- to moderate-income census tracts.  O'Connor said the initial review found about 200 of 603 applications came from low-income census tracts.  Earmarked funds include:  • $1.5 million for cash incentives of up to $10,000 for retained payroll at businesses with fewer than 15 full-time equivalent employees.  • $3 million for 10-year, zero-interest loans up to $50,000, with long-term employee retention factoring into loan forgiveness considerations, and for 10-year, 2% interest loans of $50,000 to $100,000. Businesses with fewer than 50 full-time equivalent employees qualified.  O'Connor said about 60 applications that came from outside the city limits were disqualified.  Also Tuesday, the Oklahoma City Economic Development Trust approved an economic development agreement worth up to $2.3 million in taxpayer incentives for Heartland Payment Systems LLC and a developer for Heartland's new 100,000-square-foot headquarters building under construction at NW 5 Street and Broadway Avenue.

British Library to archive Radio 4 listeners’ experiences of pandemic life   29 Apr 2020, 23:16    Listeners of the PM programme were asked to write to the BBC about their experiences of the lockdown.     British Library   The British Library is set to archive BBC Radio 4’s listeners’ experiences of the coronavirus pandemic.  Covid Chronicles, which was launched by the PM programme last month, saw presenter Evan Davis ask the public to write into the programme with their accounts of life during the pandemic.  Their responses will be permanently stored in the British Library “to document the national experience”, the BBC said.    (Ian West/PA)   Hundreds wrote to the programme with their personal accounts of what living through the lockdown has been like for them.  People who sent in their testimonies included a woman preparing to give birth during the pandemic and a Jewish family getting ready for Passover.  A woman’s reflections on her mother’s funeral were also sent to the broadcaster.  Polly Russell, lead curator for contemporary politics and public life at the British Library, said: “We are really excited about these Covid Chronicles because they provide a snapshot in a time of national crisis.  “They have this wonderful quality of being personal, intimate, surprising and sometimes funny, often moving and they will be a wonderful record of this time and a brilliant resource for researchers in the future.”	News
All but one coronavirus death in Virginia’s capital have been black Americans. The county’s health director isn’t surprised.  29 Apr 2020, 15:17 by Kelly McLaughlin, Business Insider US      Danny Avula, the director of health districts in Richmond, Virginia, and Henrico County, Virginia, told Insider that 13 of the 14 people to die from COVID-19 in Richmond are black.  Richmond has had 312 COVID-19 cases, 60 hospitalizations, and 14 deaths. White patients account for just 22.1% of COVID-19 cases, while black patients account for 58.3%.  Avula said that the disproportionately higher death rate in black communities is tied to “decades and centuries of structural inequity.”  Visit Business Insider’s homepage for more stories .   Almost all of the people to die from COVID-19 in Richmond, Virginia, are black Americans, according to Danny Avula, the director of Richmond and Henrico Health Districts.  Avula told Insider that black residents account for 13 of the city’s 14 COVID-19 deaths. The statistic shows that COVID-19 deaths are disproportionately affecting black communities ion Richmond, where, with a population of around 228,000, 45.4% of its residents are white, 47.8% are black, and 6.7 % are Hispanic.  “The fact that more African Americans in the city are dying of this, that’s not something new that’s specific to COVID-19. That’s a revelation of the underlying inequities that we have always dealt with, and this is just one more thing that’s bringing that to the forefront,” Avula told Insider. “It’s all rooted in decades and centuries of structural inequity.”  Virginia, as a whole, has had 14,339 COVID-19 cases and 492 deaths from the virus. Richmond alone has had 312 COVID-19 cases, 60 hospitalizations, and 14 deaths.  White patients account for just 22.1% of COVID-19 cases in Richmond, while black patients account for 58.3%. In total, white people have accounted for 68 cases and nine hospitalizations in the city, while black people account for 182 cases and 44 hospitalizations. Of the 14 deaths, 13 of the victims were black.  Racial minorities are being hit harder by COVID-19  Across the US, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has found that racial minorities have been disproportionately impacted by COVID-19.  That’s because, the CDC said, racial minorities are more likely to live in densely populated areas and multi-generational households, and make up a disproportionate number of the country’s incarcerated population – all factors that hinder social distancing. The agency also said that many racial minorities work at essential businesses, don’t have access to paid sick leave, and have underlying health conditions.  “The reality is that black Americans are disproportionately in lower socioeconomic strata, and therefore have higher exposure based on the jobs they have to work and that they’re relying on public transportation,” Avula said, adding that many of Richmond’s black residents work in healthcare institutions and at essential businesses.  Experts have said that black communities on average are in worse health than other groups. Studies have also found that black people might be less likely to seek medical help because of a distrust in the American health system, which has a history marred with racist experiments, including one in Tuskegee in which 400 men were part of a syphilis study without their knowledge.  In a column for The Root published on Tuesday , civil rights leaders Rev. Dr. William J Barber II and Rashad Robinson wrote that black communities shouldn’t be blamed for having higher COVID-19 rates, but instead, should be provided with support and resources to help them prevent the spread of the virus.  “Black people have higher rates of asthma and are more likely to die from this virus because environmental racism has kept communities of color segregated near industrial pollutants that other communities can afford to avoid. Black people are overrepresented in institutions unable to allow for social distancing, like jails and prisons, because we’ve been targeted and over-criminalized for generations. Black people are concentrated in parts of the labor market that don’t have the infrastructure for paid time off or work-from-home options because our health and safety have never been a priority,” Barber and Robinson wrote. “Now, our country has to reconcile the inequality it has created.”  Virginia is trying to increase its testing abilities and provide black communities with personal protective gear during the pandemic  Virginia lags behind other states in administering coronavirus tests, according to the Washington Pos t. As of Tuesday, Virginia had administered 82,753 tests to its 8.536 million residents – that’s just 9,700 tests per 1 million residents, The Post reported.  Virginia officials are trying to improve their testing capabilities and are reaching out to regions that could face issues with access to tests.  “It is very important to let all Virginians – whatever neighborhood they come from, or whatever walk of life – know that we’re here for them,” Governor Ralph Northam said at one testing site, according to The Post. “We want to take care of them.”  In Richmond, government officials have started sharing COVID-19 data directly with public housing communities, setting up free walk-in testing sites, and providing residents with hand sanitizer, masks, and other personal protective gear during the pandemic.  “I think just being able to share information and help people understand that this is not some abstract threat out there, but there’s actually people in their own community that have the disease – it doesn’t mean we need to panic,” Avula said. “But it does mean that we should adhere to our physical distancing and stay-at-home measures more than we might otherwise.”	NotNews

The vast majority - 660 cases - are work permit holders residing in foreign worker dormitories, the Ministry of Health (MOH) said in its daily update.  Nineteen are work permit holders living outside dormitories.  ""The number of new cases among work permit holders residing outside dormitories has decreased, from an average of 29 cases per day in the week before, to an average of 18 per day in the past week,"" said MOH.  ""The main increase today continues to be for work permit holders residing in dormitories, where we are picking up many more cases because of extensive testing.""  Six of the new cases are Singaporeans or permanent residents - the lowest such figure in about two weeks since MOH started giving a breakdown according to confirmed cases in the local community.  Five of the new cases are work pass holders, bringing the total number in the local community on Wednesday to 11.  ""The number of new cases in the community has decreased, from an average of 25 cases per day in the week before, to an average of 17 per day in the past week.

Five new clusters were also identified - at 11 Defu Lane 1, 106 International Road, 33 Senoko Way, 17 Shaw Road, and 182 Woodlands Industrial Park E5.  A total of 62 more cases of COVID-19 infection have been discharged from hospitals or community isolation facilities.

International Cricket Council bans Deepak Agarwal for two years   29 Apr 2020, 12:55    General manager Alex Marshall said: “There were a number of examples of Mr Agarwal obstructing and delaying our investigations.”     A former part-owner of a T10 side in the UAE has been banned from cricket for two years   Deepak Agarwal, one of the team owners at the 2018 T10 Cricket League, has been banned from the sport for two years by the International Cricket Council.  Agarwal was part-owner of the Sindhis franchise, whose squad included England World Cup winner Jofra Archer as well as compatriots Dawid Malan and Joe Clarke.  The ban, six months of which are suspended, comes after Agarwal accepted one charge of breaching the ICC’s Anti-Corruption Code.  Agarwal was charged under article 2.4.7, which relates to: “Obstructing or delaying an investigation, including concealing, tampering with or destroying any documentation or other information that may be relevant to that investigation and/or that may be evidence of or may lead to the discovery of evidence of corrupt conduct under the ICC Anti-Corruption Code.”  Sindhis finished bottom of the Super League at the 2018 staging of the tournament in the United Arab Emirates after winning just one of their six games.  ICC general manager for integrity Alex Marshall said: “There were a number of examples of Mr Agarwal obstructing and delaying our investigations and it was not just a one-off occurrence.  “However, he made a prompt admission of his breach of the ICC Anti-Corruption Code and continues to provide substantial assistance to the ACU in relation to several investigations involving other participants.  This cooperation is reflected in his sanction.”	News
The best wheels for sim racing on PC right now  29 Apr 2020, 12:00 by Richard Devine   Source: Windows Central   Best Racing Wheels for PC Windows Central 2020  Sim racing has exploded in 2020, and the beauty is that literally anyone can get involved. All you need to join in with some of the top titles like iRacing and Raceroom is a PC and a wheel. So, if you're out shopping for a wheel to get yourself racing, here's what to get.    Best Overall: Thrustmaster T300 RS GT    Runner-up: Logitech G920    Best Budget: Thrustmaster T150    Higher-end: Thrustmaster TS-XW    Best Direct Drive: Fanatec Podium Racing Wheel F1    Best Overall: Thrustmaster T300 RS GT      Source: Thrustmaster   The T300 RS GT isn't the most expensive wheel, nor is it the most feature-packed or advanced when it comes to the tech inside. But what it is, for most people, is a fantastic all-rounder that balances all of these things. It's approachable for newcomers with an attractive price, yet still delivers a quality experience.  Ignore the fact it's a Gran Turismo branded product, it's as good, if not better on PC than on PS4. The wheel rim itself is 11-inches in diameter but is also detachable and replaced by several alternatives, including a replica Ferrari F1 effort. Thrustmaster also has an extensive ecosystem of accessories that will work with the T300 RS GT.  The T300 RS GT also boasts an adjustable rotation up to 1080-degrees, and force feedback is delivered by a frictionless dual belt-driven system powered by an industrial-class brushless motor. That means it'll also last, and with a high-resolution magnetic sensor, you can be sure it's accurate and responsive.  Pros:   1080-degree rotation  Brushless motor  Interchangeable rim  Attractive price   Cons:   Rubber trim not leather  Quite plasticky   Best Overall      Thrustmaster T300 RS GT   A perfect balance of performance and price  An all-round wheel good that's good for beginners and more experienced drivers alike that boasts a beautiful asking price.    $400 at Dell    Runner-up - Logitech G920      Source: Windows Central   The Logitech G920 is, as traditionally with Logitech wheels, excellent. And part of that is based on its longevity; you can often find it at a handsome discount. But it's not good only because of its price. Logitech doesn't churn out new wheels that often, but when they come, they're excellent.  The G920 is a well-built wheel with all the creature comforts you need to go racing. That includes a built-in vibration motor that provides accurate force feedback to feel the surface you're driving on, a 900-degree rotation, a leather grip, and a full three-pedal setup.  This means you can use the optional gearshift with it if you prefer, though it is an additional purchase. For most, though, the metal paddle shifters will be plenty. It's also worth highlighting the location of the buttons because they're placed perfectly for easy access without the need to take your hands off the wheel. The G920 is the Xbox/PC version, but if you prefer there's also a PS4/PC version that's called the G29 .  Pros   Excellent design and construction  Attractive price  Three-pedal setup  Great force feedback   Cons   Stick shift additional purchase  No changeable rim   Runner-up      Logitech G920   On balance, an excellent wheel for all  The Logitech G920 is well made, well priced, and performs to such a high standard any virtual racer will be happy with it.    $390 at Dell    Best Budget: Thrustmaster T150      Source: Windows Central   Thrustmaster doesn't just cater to the super-serious sim racers out there, the company has a whole range of different wheels, and the T150 is particularly useful for those making their first steps onto the virtual tarmac or those looking for a good wheel on a tight budget.  The T150 retains features you'd find on more expensive wheels, such as a 1080-degree adjustable rotation and large paddle shifts, but cuts back in some areas such as being mostly plastic and trimmed in rubber. But with 12-bit resolution and Thrustmaster's Immersion TouchSense technology, it still feels superb and has fantastic accuracy.  The T150 is a comfortable wheel to use. It's also a high-quality product designed to appeal to the newer sim-racers or those on a tighter budget. But neither of those things means you should miss out on features, and with really nice force feedback too, it's genuinely an excellent budget wheel.  Pros:   1080-degree rotation  Large paddle shifts  Good force feedback  Amazing price   Cons:   A lot of plastic  Only two pedals as standard   Best Budget      Thrustmaster T150   A good wheel for little money  Perfect for beginners or budget buyers, the T150 keeps the price low without hindering the overall experience.    $200 at Dell    Higher-end: Thrustmaster TS-XW      Source: Windows Central   If you're searching for a higher-end racing wheel to go with your PC sim racing, this is a top choice. Thrustmaster's epic TS-XW is pricey, but it's one of the closest things you'll get to reality without having to put a helmet on.  A big part of what makes it so good is the partnership with Sparco, which makes the TS-XW's rim an actual recreation of a real-life racing wheel, the P310, right down to the authentic Alcantara trim. If you'd prefer something else, though, it supports Thrustmaster's quick-release system, and there are several replacements available.  The force feedback on this wheel is incredible, paired with a dual belt-pulley system and metal ball-bearing axle with 1080 degrees of rotation. The companion three-pedal setup also allows for an optional stick shift. The TS-XW also supports the Xbox One, but Thrustmaster has a dedicated PC version as well as a similar model, the T-GT , which supports PS4 and PC.  Pros   Excellent design and construction  Modeled on a real-life wheel  Three-pedal setup  Incredible accuracy from force feedback   Cons   Quite Pricey  Heavy!   Higher-end      Thrustmaster TS-XW   As close to real as you can get  This wheel from Thrustmaster is about as close as you can get to the real thing without having to go outside and put a helmet on.    $699 at Dell    Best Direct Drive: Fanatec Podium Racing Wheel F1      Source: Fanatec   If you want to get really serious about your sim racing, then you're going to want to jump up to a direct drive wheel at some point. Where everything else on this list relies on a system of belts and gears, direct-drive wheels attach the rim directly to the motor. The benefit here is the best quality force feedback, unlimited rotation, and the absolute best accuracy. It's the closest you can get to a real race car in your own home.  Fanatec now has a direct drive wheel that fits into its extensive ecosystem of products. The Podium also supports console, with both PS4 and Xbox One support possible, and the bundle here has a licensed F1 style wheel to get you going. What you get with the podium is smooth, accurate, highly realistic racing.  It boasts a peak torque of 20nm and a holding torque of 15nm, a built-in hub, carbon fiber and alcantara in its construction and a built-in OLED display on the base for easy tuning. You've got a host of buttons to map and an integrated display on the actual wheel. All you need to do is get some pedals, and you're off.  Pros   Ultimate realism  Superb build quality  Also supports console  Ecosystem of accessories   Cons   Expensive  Pedals aren't included   Best Direct Drive      Fanatec Podium Racing Wheel F1   Like driving the real thing in the comfort of your home  Direct drive wheels require a significant investment, but the realism is worth it, and with Fanatec's ecosystem, you're in safe hands with the Podium.    $1,800 at Fanatec    The finish line  When it comes to sim racing, the PC is the place to be, with the biggest support of both games and accessories. If you're looking to get into it for yourself and want to start with a good wheel, then the Thrustmaster T300 RS GT is an excellent place to start.  For one, it won't run away with your wallet. Sim racing can be a very expensive hobby, but the T300 keeps the price down while still offering a high-quality product and experience.  The force feedback is on point; it supports PS4 as well if you're also looking to dabble in a little GT Sport, and the rim is interchangeable if you're in the mood for something a little different. It's not the fanciest around, but when you balance everything together, it's certainly one of the very best choices.  We may earn a commission for purchases using our links. Learn more .

This Bullish Bitcoin Factor Has a 85% Strike Rate Since 2011. It’s Nearly Back  29 Apr 2020, 12:00 by Nick Chong  Despite the impressive rally Bitcoin has embarked on since March’s lows, there’s been growing uncertainty in the crypto market. Some are fearful that an extended economic recession could send cryptocurrencies tumbling, while others have suggested that BTC is on the verge of an explosive rally, citing the block reward halving.  The uncertainty may soon end with a crypto trader reporting that a bullish Bitcoin factor, which has an 85% strike rate and a sample size of 27, is about to reappear on the charts.  Highly-Accurate Bitcoin Signal Is About to Appear  Responding to the strong rally that has transpired over the past few days, the Ichimoku Cloud — an indicator tracking trends and key levels — “could soon turn fully bullish,” a trader warned.  Per the trader, should this happen, there’s a high likelihood Bitcoin will rocket higher in the coming weeks:  “1D [Ichimoku Cloud] was fully bullish on BTC 27 times. Study shows Gain if bought on candle close once fully bullish and sold once candle close below Kijun (standard strat): 23 Wins, cum. gain 3,385%, avg gain 147.17% [and] 4 Losses, cum. loss 30.39%, avg loss 7.59%.”  Below is a chart shared by the trader. It depicts a small sampling of the times the Ichimoku Cloud turned “fully bullish” for Bitcoin, and highlights how the cryptocurrency performed in the wake of such technical occurrences.  As can be seen, from this small portion of BTC’s price history (late-2014 to early-2017), the Ichimoku Cloud crossing bullish has been a strong indicator for follow-throughs to the upside on rallies.     Image from @TraderSmokey (Twitter)  This means that should the historical strike rate hold up in the current, there’s a high likelihood Bitcoin will continue to rally even higher once it appears.  Importantly, the imminence of a bullish Ichimoku Cloud could change should the crypto market crash once again.  On-Chain Data Corroborates the Cheery Outlook  Data shared by Glassnode, a crypto analytics firm, has corroborated the sentiment that Bitcoin is about to entire into a bull phase.  On April 28th, the company reported that the “Bitcoin Short-Term Holder NUPL” metric — an indicator tracking the profitability of short-term cryptocurrency investors and traders — has entered the “hope” zone.  According to Glassnode , it’s a signal that has “previously indicate the start of bull markets,” with the metric peaking above this crucial level in late-2015 prior to the 4,000% surge to $20,000, at the start of 2019’s 300% rally, and just earlier this year before BTC hit $10,500:  “A key moment to watch: Bitcoin Short Term Holder NUPL has entered the hope zone. Staying above this zone has previously indicated the start of bull markets.”     Image from Glassnode  Not to mention, per data from Coin Metrics, the number of weekly active addresses on the Bitcoin network recently breached a nine-month high, surmounting levels seen all throughout the late-2019 and early-2020 bear market.  This is important as previous upticks in this key metric coincided with the start of bull runs, with the metric rallying higher in early-2017, and exploding higher at the start of 2019.

How to Combat Zoom Fatigue  29 Apr 2020, 12:45 by by Liz Fosslien and , Mollie West Duffy  If you’re finding that you’re more exhausted at the end of your workday than you used to be, you’re not alone. Over the past few weeks, mentions of “Zoom fatigue” have popped up more and more on social media, and Google searches for the same phrase have steadily increased since early March.  Why do we find video calls so draining? There are a few reasons.  In part, it’s because they force us to focus more intently on conversations in order to absorb information. Think of it this way: when you’re sitting in a conference room, you can rely on whispered side exchanges to catch you up if you get distracted or answer quick, clarifying questions. During a video call, however, it’s impossible to do this unless you use the private chat feature or awkwardly try to find a moment to unmute and ask a colleague to repeat themselves.  The problem isn’t helped by the fact that video calls make it easier than ever to lose focus. We’ve all done it: decided that, why yes, we absolutely can listen intently, check our email, text a friend, and post a smiley face on Slack within the same thirty seconds. Except, of course, we don’t end up doing much listening at all when we’re distracted. Adding fuel to the fire is many of our work-from-home situations. We’re no longer just dialing into one or two virtual meetings. We’re also continuously finding polite new ways to ask our loved ones not to disturb us, or tuning them out as they army crawl across the floor to grab their headphones off the dining table. For those who don’t have a private space to work, it is especially challenging.  Finally, “Zoom fatigue” stems from how we process information over video. On a video call the only way to show we’re paying attention is to look at the camera. But, in real life, how often do you stand within three feet of a colleague and stare at their face? Probably never. This is because having to engage in a “constant gaze” makes us uncomfortable — and tired . In person, we are able to use our peripheral vision to glance out the window or look at others in the room. On a video call, because we are all sitting in different homes, if we turn to look out the window, we worry it might seem like we’re not paying attention. Not to mention, most of us are also staring at a small window of ourselves, making us hyper-aware of every wrinkle, expression, and how it might be interpreted. Without the visual breaks we need to refocus, our brains grow fatigued.  If this all sounds like bad news, don’t despair. We have five research-based tips that can help make video calls less exhausting.  Avoid multitasking.  It’s easy to think that you can use the opportunity to do more in less time, but research shows that trying to do multiple things at once cuts into performance. Because you have to turn certain parts of your brain off and on for different types of work, switching between tasks can cost you as much as 40 percent of your productive time. Researchers at Stanford found that people who multitask can’t remember things as well as their more singularly focused peers. The next time you’re on a video chat, close any tabs or programs that might distract you (e.g. your inbox or Slack), put your phone away, and stay present. We know it’s tempting, but try to remind yourself that the Slack message you just got can wait 15 minutes, and that you’ll be able to craft a better response when you’re not also on a video chat.  Build in breaks.  Take mini breaks from video during longer calls by minimizing the window, moving it to behind your open applications, or just looking away from your computer completely for a few seconds now and then. We’re all more used to being on video now (and to the stressors that come with nonstop facetime). Your colleagues probably understand more than you think — it is possible to listen without staring at the screen for a full thirty minutes. This is not an invitation to start doing something else, but to let your eyes rest for a moment. For days when you can’t avoid back-to-back calls, consider making meetings 25 or 50 minutes (instead of the standard half-hour and hour) to give yourself enough time in between to get up and move around for a bit. If you are on an hour-long video call, make it okay for people to turn off their cameras for parts of the call.  Reduce onscreen stimuli.  Research shows that when you’re on video, you tend to spend the most time gazing at your own face. This can be easily avoided by hiding yourself from view . Still, onscreen distractions go far beyond yourself. You may be surprised to learn that on video, we not only focus on other’s faces, but on their backgrounds as well. If you’re on a call with five people, you may feel like you’re in five different rooms at once. You can see their furniture, plants, and wallpaper. You might even strain to see what books they have on their shelves. The brain has to process all of these visual environmental cues at the same time. To combat mental fatigue, encourage people to use plain backgrounds (e.g. a poster of a peaceful beach scene), or agree as a group to have everyone who is not talking turn off their video.  Make virtual social events opt-in.  After a long day of back-to-back video calls, it’s normal to feel drained, particularly if you’re an introvert. That’s why virtual social sessions should be kept opt-in, meaning whoever owns the event makes it explicit that people are welcome, but not obligated, to join. You might also consider appointing a facilitator if you’re expecting a large group. This person can open by asking a question, and then make it clear in what order people should speak, so everyone gets to hear from one another and the group doesn’t start talking all at once. It’s easy to get overwhelmed if we don’t know what’s expected of us, or if we’re constantly trying to figure out when we should or should not chime in.  Switch to phone calls or email.  Check your calendar for the next few days to see if there are any conversations you could have over Slack or email instead. If 4PM rolls around and you’re Zoomed-out but have an upcoming one-on-one, ask the person to switch to a phone call or suggest picking up the conversation later so you can both recharge. Try something like, “I’d love a break from video calls. Do you mind if we do this over the phone?” Most likely the other person will be relieved by the switch, too.  For external calls, avoid defaulting to video, especially if you don’t know each other well.  Many people now feel a tendency to treat video as the default for all communication. In situations where you’re communicating with people outside of your organization (clients, vendors, networking, etc.) — conversations for which you used to rely on phone calls — you may feel obligated to send out a Zoom link instead. But a video call is fairly intimate and can even feel invasive in some situations. For example, if you’re asked to do a career advice call and you don’t know the person you’re talking to, sticking to phone is often a safer choice. If your client FaceTimes you with no warning, it’s okay to decline and suggest a call instead.  Some of these tips might be hard to follow at first (especially that one about resisting the urge to tab-surf during your next Zoom call). But taking these steps can help you prevent feeling so exhausted at the thought of another video chat. It’s tiring enough trying to adapt to this new normal. Make video calls a little easier for yourself.	NotNews

"Streaming films eligible for Oscars, but for 1 year only  LOS ANGELES — Movies that debuted on a streaming service without a theatrical run will be eligible for the Oscars, but only for this year.  29 Apr 2020, 12:50 by Canadian Press  LOS ANGELES — Movies that debuted on a streaming service without a theatrical run will be eligible for the Oscars, but only for this year.  The Academy of Motion Pictures Arts and Sciences on Tuesday announced the change for the 93rd Academy Awards as a response to how the coronavirus pandemic has impacted the film industry.  The film academy also said it will condense the two sound categories into one and prohibit DVD screeners for 2022's 94th Oscars in an effort to become more carbon neutral.  Oscars eligibility has been a major question since stay at home and social distancing orders led to both the cancellation of major film festivals and the closure of movie theatres. Previously, a film would have to have a minimum seven-day theatrical run in a Los Angeles County commercial theatre in order to be considered for film's highest honour. Now films that had a previously planned theatrical release but are made available on a home video on demand service may qualify for best picture and other categories.  “We’re dealing with the unfolding reality of an unanticipated, unprecedented global health crisis and trying to be responsive to what’s going on in the world and at the same time support our filmmakers who are in a circumstance beyond their control,” film academy president David Rubin told The Associated Press Tuesday.  Dawn Hudson, the CEO of the film academy, said that they have been in “constant conversation with all parts of our community from studios to filmmakers to theatre owners"" to make decisions that support all.  Earlier this month, the film academy donated $6 million to help motion picture employees and their families during this crisis.  “Our primary message is take care of yourselves,” Hudson added. “We’ll be flexible on our rules this year because we understand how unprecedented and devastating this is.”  The academy's board noted, however, that when theatres reopen, the rules exemption will no longer apply. Many expect cinemas nationwide to reopen by June or July. If that is the case, the film academy will expand the qualifying theatres beyond Los Angeles County to include venues in New York City, Chicago, San Francisco, Miami and Atlanta.  “The theatrical experience is the DNA of the academy and that communal experience of the movie theatre is something we feel is intrinsic to movies,” said Hudson.  Other changes included combining the sound mixing and sound editing categories into best achievement in sound.  “This is something long in the making and generated by the experts in the sound field. They wanted to propose this change after reviewing a long history of overlap,” Rubin said. “They wanted it to be reflective of how the sound industry works together today.”  Additionally, all film academy members are now able to vote in the first round for international feature film, the category formerly known as best foreign language film.  The board also said for a film score to be eligible in the original score category, it must have 60% original music. For sequels and franchise films, there must be a minimum of 80% new music.  Rubin and Hudson said that the film academy's response to COVID-19 will continue to be fluid. No decisions have been made yet as to plans for the annual Governors Awards, which are typically held in the fall in Los Angeles. But the 93rd Academy Awards are still a go, scheduled to be held in Los Angeles on Feb. 28, 2021.  Lindsey Bahr, The Associated Press   More World News"	News

Newcastle fans react as club linked with Ajax star Donny van de Beek  29 Apr 2020, 12:15 by Will Butcher  Newcastle United are reportedly interested in signing Ajax midfielder Donny van de Beek this summer as the prospective owners continue to work behind the scenes even before the takeover is confirmed – and Toon fans have reacted on Twitter.  Van de Beek, 23, is expected to have an interesting summer after coming close to a £47million ( Goal ) move to Real Madrid in the January transfer window. Owned by Mino Raiola, the Dutch international is expected to leave Ajax after 175 outings.  French website Le10Sport have claimed that Newcastle’s potential new owners have identified van de Beek as a player that can improve Newcastle’s midfield – but they are not alone in their pursuit of the midfielder.    (Photo by David Aliaga/MB Media/Getty Images)   Indeed, it is believed Everton are also keen on the Ajax star, while Real Madrid are also interested in landing van de Beek. As we grow deeper into the summer window, other parties are likely to become interested in the midfield dynamo.  Certainly, with the global health crisis placing club’s finances into danger, Ajax may reduce his asking price. That may see the likes of Newcastle nab a bargain, but it is also likely to attract further interest in a player that had a hand in 21 goals this term.  Newcastle supporters have reacted on Twitter to the reported news that their club are interested in signing van de Beek, and many are desperate to see him pull on a black and white shirt next season.

Two Policemen Injured in Stone Pelting by Migrant Workers at Top Indian IT Institute in Hyderabad   29 Apr 2020, 13:33    New Delhi (Sputnik): In March, when Prime Minister Narendra Modi announced a nationwide lockdown to tackle the COVID-19 pandemic, thousands of poor migrants left bigger cities on foot to return to their homes. States were instructed to take care of daily wagers wherever they were stuck.   Over 2,000 migrant workers in the Indian city of Hyderabad, Telangana state on Wednesday protested at the prestigious Indian Institute of Technology (IIT) for wage clearances for the last four months, demanding that they be allowed to travel back to their villages and hometowns.  When asked to join the construction work available in the Hyderabad campus of IIT, the labourers not only declined the offer, but resorted to violence and vandalism. They pelted stones and injured cops who tried to ensure discipline and social distancing amid the ongoing national lockdown. Two policemen were left wounded during the stone-pelting by the demonstrating workers, while a police vehicle was also damaged.  Videos of the mass protest surfaced soon on social networking platforms in India.        ​The district administration held a discussion with the union leaders of the labourers, which led to their construction company bosses agreeing to clear their salaries for March. They, however, may not get the payments for January and February for the time being.  Arrangements for fresh vegetables and food items for these workers have also been promised by the district administration, while the details of their return back home would be discussed later, local media reported.  India announced a major stimulus package of around $22.36 billion for the poor and for daily wage workers who lost their jobs during the lockdown. Several states have also issued advisories to city administrations asking them to ensure food and shelter for displaced workers. Landlords who have rented their properties to the labourers in metro cities have been asked to waive off their rents for some time.  Despite the measures, thousands of migrants are still walking for miles, from state to state, crossing cities and tolls, hoping to reach their hometowns soon amid the ongoing COVID-19 lockdown.	News

ICC hands two-year ban to Indian owner of T10 franchise for breaching anti-corruption code  Agarwal, who owned T10 team Sindhis for a while, was charged as a participant under the code for unfair practices during the 2018 edition.  29 Apr 2020, 13:32 by Press Trust of India  The International Cricket Council on Wednesday banned Deepak Agarwal, an Indian businessman who owned a franchise in the 2018 T10 League held in the UAE, after he admitted to obstructing an ongoing anti-corruption investigation.  Six months of this two-year ban is a suspended sentence due to the cooperation he has offered since admitting his violation of the anti-corruption code.  Agarwal, who owned T10 team Sindhis for a while, was charged as a participant under the code for unfair practices during the 2018 edition.  According to Anti-Corruption Unit’s detailed report, Agarwal was charged for destroying evidence in collusion with an unidentified ‘Mr X’, who is also described as a participant.  “Mr Agarwal instructed Mr X to delete all the messages they had entered into between each other and to delete his number from his phone before attending the ACU investigation,” the ICC order stated.  Article 2.4.7, under which Agarwal was charged, deals with “...concealing, tampering with or destroying any documentation or other information” which is relevant to an ongoing investigation.”  Under the provisions of the Code, Agarwal chose to admit the charges and accepted the sanction in lieu of an Anti-Corruption Tribunal hearing.  “Subject to him satisfying conditions in respect of the suspended part of the sanction, he will be free to resume his involvement in the game on 27 October 2021,” the ICC stated.  Alex Marshall, ICC General Manager Integrity said: “There were a number of examples of Agarwal obstructing and delaying our investigations and it was not just a one off occurrence.  “However, he made a prompt admission of his breach of the ICC Anti-Corruption Code and continues to provide substantial assistance to the ACU in relation to several investigations involving other participants.  “This cooperation is reflected in his sanction.”  The ICC said Agarwal has been cooperating with the world body now and it found that “the offence did not substantially damage the commercial value and/or public interest in any match” and did not affect the “outcome of matches.

"Govt allows Evercare, Square and United to run COVID-19 tests on inpatients  29 Apr 2020, 13:35 by bdnews24.com   The government has granted permission to three private hospitals in Dhaka to test inpatients with COVID-19 symptoms for the infection amid a surge in cases and deaths in Bangladesh, according to the health directorate.   Evercare, Square and United are the latest private facilities to be given the greenlight after US-Bangla Medical College Hospital, which began testing samples on Wednesday.  Although US-Bangla Medical College can examine samples of outpatients, the three hospitals in Dhaka are only allowed to test those of patients who are already admitted there, DGHS Additional Director General Nasima Sultana said.  ""It must be kept in mind that the three hospitals can only test the samples of inpatients for COVID-19. We haven't yet given them permission to test samples of outpatients as it could cause problems with the follow-ups,"" she said.  Nasima said the DGHS would consider if any hospital outside Dhaka applies for permission to run coronavirus test upon inspection of their facilities.  The government also granted the four private hospitals permission to continue treatment of the patients who test positive for COVID-19, she said.  The fee for the test is Tk 3,500 in line with the rates fixed by the government for the purchase of kits and other costs. The government will supply the testing kits and other equipment.  The four hospitals are among a total of 29 facilities that conduct coronavirus test in Bangladesh.  The 25 other facilities conduct the test for free under government supervision.  The test is also free for outpatients of the US-Bangla hospital.  Bangladesh registered eight more deaths from the novel coronavirus in the 24 hours to 8am Wednesday, bringing the body count to 163.  The tally of COVID-19 infections surged to 7,103 after another 641 people, in a single-day record jump, tested positive in the same period, Nasima said on Wednesday."	News
"Murray says resuming season stalled by pandemic not top priority   29 Apr 2020, 13:50   Resuming the tennis season stalled by the coronavirus pandemic is not the most important thing as players first want to live their normal lives again, former world number one Andy Murray said.  REUTERS: Resuming the tennis season stalled by the coronavirus pandemic is not the most important thing as players first want to live their normal lives again, former world number one Andy Murray said.  Professional tennis has been suspended since March because of the outbreak and the ATP and WTA Tours have said the hiatus will continue at least until mid-July.  Murray had previously said that tennis would be one of the last sports to resume.  ""I'm sure all tennis players want to get back to competing as soon as possible,"" Murray said following his win over Rafa Nadal in the virtual Madrid Open esports tournament.  ""But right now, that is not the most important thing. First of all, we want to get our normal lives back. Then, hopefully, over time things will start to allow for travelling and sport will be able to go back to normal.  ""But I don't see that happening very soon ... The first thing is to try and find a way to stop the virus spreading and once we've done that we'll be able to do more normal things rather than thinking about competing in sport.""  Murray said reopening borders for international travel could stall the progress made in curbing the spread of the virus.  ""If we get back to international travel, then maybe there could be a second wave of infections,"" he said.  ""That would slow everything down again and that's not what anyone wants. Let's just get things back to normal first.""  Murray also had a bit of banter with Nadal after handing out the Spanish 19-times Grand Slam singles champion a lesson in video game.  In a post-match interview, Murray said: ""If you speak to Rafa, tell him not to be such a bad loser next time.""  ""I don't need to train a lot to beat him in this game. He's not very good,"" Murray joked, after his 3-0 win during which he lost only one point. ""If I practised a lot, it would have been even worse for him today!""  Nadal said he was not in the frame of mind to go out and compete on a tennis court when the lockdown ends.  ""My hope is to see my family and friends again and to go out for a party or to the sea to swim,"" the 33-year-old told the Spanish press recently. ""I want to feel free again and be able to hug my loved ones, as I'm a loving person.  ""I can't conceive a future where I can't hug players I haven't seen in months.""

White House asks agencies to find out if China, WHO hid coronavirus intel  29 Apr 2020, 13:39 by Yaron Steinbuch  The White House has ordered US spy agencies to investigate whether China and the World Health Organization initially covered up what they knew about the nascent coronavirus pandemic, according to a new report.  A specific “tasking” seeking information about the emerging outbreak was sent last week to the National Security Agency and the Defense Intelligence Agency, an official directly familiar with the matter told NBC News .  The CIA received similar instructions, current and former US officials told the network, which reported that the agencies were ordered to comb through a variety of data, including satellite photos and communication intercepts in the effort.  President Trump appeared to allude to the matter during a White House briefing Monday, when he was asked about holding China accountable for the outbreak that has infected more than 3 million people around the world.  “We’re doing very serious investigations,” the president said. “We are not happy with that whole situation, because we believe it could have been stopped at the source, it could have been stopped quickly, and it wouldn’t have spread all over the world.”  Among other things, the spy agencies were asked to find out what the WHO knew about two labs studying coronaviruses in China’s Wuhan Province, where the deadly bug first emerged.  The National Institutes of Health has revealed it is investigating a Chinese lab where the outbreak is speculated to have emerged.  The director of the Wuhan Institute of Virology recently denied that the virus accidentally spread from his facility.  American intelligence officials have said China initially failed to disclose the seriousness of the outbreak, NBC News previously reported, robbing the world of vital information that might have limited its spread.  “As the president has said, the United States is thoroughly investigating this matter,” White House spokesman Hogan Gidley told the network.  “Understanding the origins of the virus is important to help the world respond to this pandemic but also to inform rapid-response efforts to future infectious disease outbreaks,” he said.  The CIA and the Office of the Director of National Intelligence declined to comment to the network.	NotNews
Community Housing Providers Welcome Government Funding To Keep Vulnerable People Housed  29 Apr 2020, 13:01 by Community Housing Aotearoa  Community housing providers are welcoming the Government’s funding boost for homelessness as a key part of an affordable housing-led economic recovery.  “Providing permanent homes that people can afford is the right thing to focus on as New Zealand restarts the economy,” says Scott Figenshow, Chief Executive of Community Housing Aotearoa (CHA), the sector’s umbrella organisation.  He was commenting on the Government’s announcement of $107.6 million to house vulnerable people during and beyond the Covid-19 pandemic ( https://www.beehive.govt.nz/release/keeping-vulnerable-people-housed ). Housing Minister Megan Woods says the funding package will enable people to stay housed until more long-term homes are secured.  Mr Figenshow says community housing providers have emphasised the need to ensure people who have been housed during the Covid-19 lockdown are not allowed to slip back into homelessness.  “We’re glad that message has been heard and the Government is increasing the country’s response to homelessness. Having a good home that’s safe, warm and affordable is a fundamental human right, and we really commend the Government for this step.  “The message from the community housing sector is to keep going. There’s a real opportunity here for the Government to develop an economy recovery based on affordable housing. As a country we need to stimulate solutions that provide us with good homes and neighbourhoods, both through the community housing sector as well as through its agency, Kāinga Ora.”   © Scoop Media	News

"Say it with lamingtons: Australian medicos on London's frontline get a taste of home  29 Apr 2020, 22:33 by Bevan Shields  London: On the footpath outside a busy London hospital, a spray-painted sign captures the mood of a nation about the staff working inside: ""You are the real heroes. Thank you.""  The praise sits uncomfortably with Judy Cotterill, an Australian-born lead nurse at the busy Royal Brompton Hospital in Chelsea.  ""I don't think I'm a hero,"" Cotterill says. ""I'm just doing my job.""    Judy Cotterill, an Australian-born lead nurse working for the National Health Service during the coronavirus crisis. Credit: Ian Tuttle   Cotterill and other Australians on the frontline of Britain's deadly coronavirus outbreak have felt frightened and anxious in the frantic weeks since the pandemic took hold. They have good reason to be scared: more than 105 hospital medicos and care home staff have died simply by coming to work to save others.  ""The experience is a bit like being the first on the scene of a car crash. You just take a deep breath and think 'hey, what do I do?', and then you just get on with it,"" Cotterill says.     ""It's something probably none of us ever expected to do. Initially it was a bit frightening because we didn't know what was going to happen but we all pulled together and supported each other.""  Britain's treasured National Health System is heavily reliant on foreign workers to keep pace with demand.  Thousands of Australians work as doctors, nurses and specialists in hospitals across the country, and are enduring physically gruelling and emotionally draining shifts their colleagues back home have so far managed to avoid .  Claire Jackman, who has been working as an intensive care nurse during the crisis, only joined the NHS in December after relocating from Brisbane.    Intensive care unit nurse Claire Jackman only moved to the UK in 2019. Credit: Ian Tuttle   ""There's a lot of anxiety around the whole situation. But it has been going on for seven or eight weeks now so it is becoming our new normal,"" she says.  ""My friends keep asking 'how is it?' and I have to say to them 'I just can't explain, it's hard to describe'. It is tough. It's hard being away from your family but knowing Australia is doing quite well with its case numbers definitely makes being away from home much more assuring.""  As hospitals began to fill with patients, the normally bustling kitchen at Australia House fell silent as Britain's lockdown went into force. Australia's high commissioner to the United Kingdom, George Brandis, soon came up with an idea.  ""We cooked lamingtons!"" says Brandis, a self-confessed lamington aficionado. The treat was invented in Brandis' home state by the French-born chef to the governor of Queensland, Lord Lamington.    Australian high commissioner George Brandis meets NHS staff at Royal Brompton Hospital in London. Credit: Ian Tuttle   ""The Lamington is Queensland's contribution to world cuisine,"" Brandis says with a wry smile.  The high commissioner and his team ended up making 500 of them. They packed the goodies in 12 boxes and dropped them off Royal Brompton Hospital on Wednesday as a token of thanks from Australians in the UK to all NHS staff.  ""There is a very large number of Australians working so hard for the NHS as doctors, nurses and paramedics ,"" Brandis says. ""Like all NHS staff, they are absolutely heroic in putting their health and indeed lives at risk in treating others during this terrible pandemic.""  The number of people in hospital with COVID-19 in UK hospitals fell from 18,388 to 15,356 over the past week. The UK death toll stands at 26,097.  The hospital's associate director, Lawrence Mack, helped unload the delivery: ""We're so proud of all our staff who have been working tirelessly, doing amazing work in unprecedented times. Gestures like this really do bring lots of smiles to people's faces.""    A National Health Service worker enjoys one of the lamingtons made by the Australian High Commission in London. Credit: Ian Tuttle   Cathy West, another Australian who serves as the hospital's principal echocardiographer, says keeping morale high should not be underestimated - particularly when the disease poses such a big risk to front-line workers.  ""I don't think even health workers expected to be putting their lives on the line. Lots of emergency services do: the police and firies for example. But it's not something normally associated with healthcare.""  West and her team are performing cardiac ultrasounds on ICU patients badly affected by the inflammatory effects of the virus.

Colts add 10 undrafted rookies, including kicker Rodrigo Blankenship  29 Apr 2020, 22:42 by AP  INDIANAPOLIS — The Indianapolis Colts now have two kickers under contract for next season while the NFL’s career scoring leader, Adam Vinatieri, remains a free agent.  On Wednesday, team officials announced they had signed 10 undrafted rookies, including Rodrigo Blankenship of Georgia, one of last season’s top college kickers.  Blankenship will now battle Chase McLaughlin , who replaced the injured Vinatieri late last season, and perhaps Vinatieri — if the Colts decide to bring him back.  “I won’t comment on that,” general manager Chris Ballard said Saturday when asked if the addition of Blankenship indicates the Colts would not re-sign Vinatieri. “And no, I still have to have talks with Adam.”  Vinatieri is coming off the worst season of a brilliant 24-year career during which he won four Super Bowl rings and had some of the most memorable kicks in league history.  But he missed a league-high 14 kicks — six extra points and eight field goals — last season before going on injured reserve in December. He had surgery on his left knee and has been recuperating ever since, hoping for a June return.  But the recovery process has been complicated by the COVID-19 pandemic restrictions.  Vinatieri told local television station FOX59 on Wednesday he still hopes to kick next season and that Ballard tried to contact him during the draft while he was hunting with his son.  The 47-year-old Vinatieri has scored a record 2,673 points, ranks second all-time in games played (365) and and would become the second-oldest player in NFL history to appear in a game — if he makes an opening day roster. Only the late George Blanda and Morten Andersen have played after turning 47.  “Before all of this, my thought was get back and get healthy and if I can kick well, shoot, I figured I could earn a job,” Vinatieri said. “I knew with a six-month, June (timetable), it was going to be tight anyway. If anything, this is going to prolong my recovery.”  Indy didn’t waste any time giving McLaughlin a one-year extension after last season ended. He went 11 of 11 on extra points and 5 of 6 on field goals with the Colts.  Blankenship made 80 of 97 field goals (81.8%) and all 200 extra points at Georgia.  The Colts also signed six defensive players, including undrafted rookies Kameron Cline of South Dakota, Kendall Coleman of Syracuse and Chris Williams of Wagner .  Indy’s other signees are tight end Farrod Green of Mississippi State, receiver DeMichael Harris of Southern Mississippi, offensive tackle tackle Carter O’Donnell from the University of Alberta in Canada, cornerback Travis Reed of South Alabama, safety Donald Rutledge of Georgia Southern and linebacker Brandon Wellington of Washington .

"New breakthrough could help us understand how rare childhood brain disorders develop  A new breakthrough in understanding the cause of rare childhood brain disorders has been made by researchers at the University of Sheffield.  27 Apr 2020, 04:00 by University of Sheffield  Researchers from the University of Sheffield have discovered a new insight into how a group of rare childhood brain disorders develop during pregnancy.  Findings reveal that defective immune cells in the brain contribute to the development of rare neurological diseases that cause severe physical and mental disabilities in children.  One in 7,600 children are affected and at the moment there are very limited treatment options for them.  Results could be used to help pave the way for the development of better therapies.  A new breakthrough in understanding the cause of rare childhood brain disorders has been made by researchers at the University of Sheffield.  The discovery by academics from the University's Neuroscience Institute and Bateson Centre has revealed that defective immune cells in the brain called microglia contribute to the development of leukodystrophies.  Leukodystrophies are a group of rare neurological diseases that cause severe physical and mental disabilities in children. One in 7,600 children are affected by the disorders which include symptoms that usually appear in the first year of life and get progressively worse as the child grows older.  Very few treatments are currently available for the diseases which, as with other rare disorders, can leave those affected feeling incredibly isolated.  However, the research by the University of Sheffield-led team has revealed a new insight into how the diseases often develop - a discovery that could be used to create more effective therapies.  Results from the study, published in the journal Glia , suggest that the disorders start during brain development in pregnancy.  Nearly half of our neurons die during the formation of our brain throughout pregnancy and it is the role of microglia to clear them away.  Using transparent zebrafish models to directly observe how brain cells develop, the research team found that the microglia were impaired when trying to clear away the dying neurons in the brains that went on to develop a leukodystrophy.  Animal models of leukodystrophy are rare and often don't look like the human pathology, as they lack the characteristic brain abnormalities and movement problems seen in human patients. However, researchers have created the first zebrafish model for human leukodystrophy and have shown that this model had similar physical and brain anomalies to patients.  Dr Noémie Hamilton, European Leukodystrophy Association (ELA) Research Fellow at the University of Sheffield, said: ""The first and main challenge for microglia during brain development is to clear away dying neurons.  ""We found that in our zebrafish model of human leukodystrophy, deficient microglia failed to digest dying neurons. Cells digest their content using their lysosomes which are an acidic cellular compartment used as a recycling factory. We showed that our zebrafish model had lysosomal defects, blocking microglia from performing normally.  ""This was associated with an inflammatory response which could damage the brain and be the start of the pathology of the disease."" The study highlights that focusing on early dysfunctions during brain development and their consequences will provide a better understanding of these rare devastating diseases.  In the future, Dr Hamilton aims to test whether therapies targeting microglia in early life can alleviate the symptoms using her unique zebrafish preclinical model. She hopes that her findings can be translated into human studies to help identify new ways to treat childhood leukodystrophies.   The research was funded by a European Leukodystrophy Association (ELA) fellowship to Dr Hamilton at The Bateson Centre, a world-leading centre using zebrafish to model human diseases at the University of Sheffield.

Meryl Streep Is The ‘Ultimate Quarantine Mood’ Shaking Up Martini On Concert & Twitter Can’t Get Enough  27 Apr 2020, 04:07 by Cassie Gill  Meryl Streep appeared on a virtual concert for legendary composer Stephen Sondheim’s 90th birthday, and had the viral moment of the night with her cocktail!  Meryl Streep , 70, can do no wrong! The Oscar winner is seemingly getting through quarantine with a cocktail (or two), according to her appearance on the virtual 90th birthday concert for legendary composer Stephen Sondheim ! Meryl popped up on the star-studded special to sing “The Ladies Who Lunch” alongside Christine Baranski and Audra McDonald , and expertly shook up her very own martini at the same time!  “And here’s to the girls who play smart — aren’t they a gas?/Rushing to their classes in optical art,” she sang from the 1970’s song, penned by Stephen for the play Company . The 70-year-old was cozy in a cream robe as she joined in the virtual Zoom concert from home, rocking her signature wire glasses. “Perhaps a piece of Mahler’s/I’ll drink to that,” she continued singing, as she poured the martini into her glass (complete with lemon zest) and proceeded to take a very big sip!  The Twitterverse couldn’t get enough of the Meryl moment, and quickly turned the it into a meme! “Here’s the Meryl martini quarantine gif I didn’t know I needed until tonight,” @michcoll hilariously tweeted, adding a looped video image of the Big Little Lies star pouring the cocktail. “Meryl Streep being the ultimate quarantine mood,” @streep_lover declared, while fan @sincerely__ivy wrote, “My new spirit animal is Meryl Streep making a martini and then chugging a bottle of whiskey after, while singing to ‘Ladies Who Lunch.'”     It turns out that the Oscar winner also happened to reveal she shares something in common with 007 agent James Bond: “The world learned today that Meryl prefers her martini shaken not stirred. Duly noted,” Twitter user @vchau2020 pointed out. The It’s Complicated actress didn’t stop with the dry martini, as she went on to open an entire bottle of whiskey for her Sunday evening in. We’re guessing she was planning to share with husband Don Gummer ? Either way, the move led fan @antiqueroman to dub the acting legend her “patronus” after drinking the scotch right out of the bottle!        Meryl was one of many A-Listers to unite for the “The Take Me To The World: A Sondheim 90th Birthday Celebration” special, which also served as benefit for charity Artists Striving To End Poverty. Jake Gyllenhaal , Neil Patrick Harris , Josh Groban , Ben Platt and Kristin Chenoweth also made appearances on the virtual stream.   More Meryl Streep News:	NotNews

COVID-19 fight lacks proper coordination — Kpakol  27 Apr 2020, 02:37 by Urowayino Jeremiah  Kindly Share This Story:  …Says Benchmark should be reduced to $20pbl …You can’t lockdown indefinitely …Where is protocol for re-opening economy?  By Emma Ujah, Abuja Bureau Chief     Former Chief Economic Adviser and Chief Executive Officer (CEO) of the National Planning Commission, Prof. Magnus Kpakol, has called for better coordination of Nigeria’s fight against the coronavirus pandemic.  Speaking in an interview with Vanguard, yesterday, he observed that fight against the pandemic, especially with respect to saving livelihoods in the country lacked proper coordination, requiring an urgent action to save the nation’s economy from the coronavirus consequences.  READ ALSO: COVID-19: I will not totally lockdown Ebonyi – Gov. Umahi  According to him, “There are two sides to the fight against the coronavirus pandemic. There is the fight to save lives and there is a fight to save livelihoods. There is no proper coordination of the Economic side of the COVId-19 pandemic –which is the livelihood. We are copying people who have large sums of stimulus running into trillions of dollars. The vice president should be made to head the economic stimulus, aspect of the fight against the pandemic.  “When the governors said they could not reach the president, they had to write a letter to the SGF. I don’t care whether it is the SGF who has to head the economic team, SGF is smart enough but there should be a better coordination. While the Presidential Task Force (PTF) headed by the SGF concerns itself with how to save the lives of Nigerians, by doing everything necessary to contain the spread of the virus; providing data, equipment, and all necessary medical products to ensure and early defeat of the virus in the country, there must a team to focus on minimizing the economic impact of the pandemic on the people.  “In my view, the Vice president who is in charge of the economy must be brought on board in this respect. He should have a Think Tank that can think through concrete steps to be taken to mitigate the effects of the COVId-19 on our economy.  “Right now there is a lockdown in the country. Remember that the MSMEs constitute about 80 per cent of the companies in the country and play a significant role in providing jobs while accounting for well over 50 per cent of our economy.  Where is protocol for re-opening the economy?  The former Chief Economic Adviser queried the absence of a protocol for re-opening the economy, after the lockdown. He argued, “You can’t lockdown the nation indefinitely. According to him, after almost a month of lockdown, there federal government should have, by now, come up with a protocol on how to restart the economy.”  He also lamented that inadequacy in the coordination of the pandemic in the country was evident in the fact that there is not enough mobilization at the grassroots.  Prof. Kpakol opined that Local Government Authorities should have been sufficiently mobilized to be part of the fight against the pandemic, “because they know the people in their domain who could also be mobilized to make donations into a pool of funds to assist the very poor members of their communities.”  In addition, he said that what the federal government could do in such a situation should have been to match such funds and that, by doing so, the palliatives would get to all those who genuinely deserve them.  “We are talking about commercial drivers, vulcanisers, barbers, tailors, hair dressers , plumbers and such other artisans. These people are locked down at home. What is the palliative for people in that category?  “The money that the Minister of Humanitarian Services has been going about, giving out to people is conditional cash transfer. It is a different programme altogether. I was the one that introduced it (as National Coordinator of the National Poverty Eradication Programme), many years ago. It is not the same as direct COVID-19 palliatives to the people in order to cushion the effects of the lockdown on the people.”  He said the current random hand-out of cash would not be effect because the federal government had no accurate data on poor people in the country.  Budget should be reviewed to $20pbl  The former CEO of the National Planning Commission noted that the reviewed $30 per barrel was not sufficient, given the market realities, where oil prices have fallen far below that benchmark. He suggested that the federal government should review the benchmark downward further to about $20 pbl. As at yesterday, Brent Crude was $21. 44, while OPEC Basket price was a mere $15.23 pbl, way below production cost in the country.  Prof. Kpakol said that there was no guarantee of oil price rebound in time soon because of the effects of the pandemic on global economy. He said that it could take up to the end of the year for oil prices to pick up to $30pbl and that, without a further downward review, the budget deficit could overtake revenue of the government in the fiscal year.  “You cannot review budget every day, as oil prices move. But with a benchmark of $20pbl, you can comfortably say, if there is an increase, this is what to do in that scenario. This is how to accommodate the extra that comes. It is better to have a benchmark that is below oil prices than a benchmark that you are not sure of realizing it. It will put a strain on the budget implementation.”  How to fund fight against COVID-19  On how to fund the fight against the COVID-19 Pandemic in the country, Prof. Kpakol said “There have been donations by the Nigerian private sector operators, led by the Central Bank, Dangote, Otedola, Adenuga and the like, the European Union donation and several other contributions from other organizations, the federal has applied for its $3. 4 billion contributions to the International Monetary Fund.  “Apart from the above, the federal government may have to borrow or pursue the debt relief like other African countries in other to free funds to be able to fight the pandemic.”  Kindly Share This Story:  Related	NotNews

Twelve South StayGo USB-C Hub is keeping me connected while working from home  27 Apr 2020, 20:30 by Jim Gresham     If you listened to the iDB podcast Let’s Talk iOS  episode 338 , you heard me talk about the ways I continue to increase my work from home (WFH) efficiency, during this shelter in place order. Taking stock of my situation, I realized I missed a key component to the setup: a solid USB-C hub. Digging around the possibilities, I came upon the StayGo USB-C hub by Twelve South . They make quality products that I’ve tested before, and I decided to give it a ‘Go.’ It’s going very well.  The setup  To give you a little background, I use a MacBook Pro for work, but have an iMac with an external monitor at home. Since being shifted to WFH status, I shuffled a few things around on my desk, making the external monitor front and center, iMac to the side, giving my MacBook Pro center stage. A couple of things have been coming up over the past few weeks.     First, a struggling Wi-Fi signal was slowing me down. My home is all covered by Wi-Fi, but my iMac gets the ethernet connectivity, because it is always in one place. I rarely sit at my home desk with my work MBPro. Even though my Eero mesh network typically gets me about 250 down and up in the home office, I felt like being hardwired could only help.  Second, to connect to my external monitor, I needed a USB-C to HDMI cable. Got it. No problem. I just borrowed it off the iMac.  Third, I obviously need power. I screwed a surge protector to the bottom of my standing desk to prevent a zillion wires from dangling to the floor. The MBPro power brick is hidden under the desk and the USB-C cable comes over the top to plug in.     My second and third items are causing the fourth problem: I hate having two USB-C plugs to pop in and out, any time I move elsewhere. First world problem at its finest. I usually spend the afternoons lounging in a bean bag chair. Yes, I’m a child.  Fifth is the issue of my iPad, which I’d like to connect to and charge with the MacBook Pro, but currently find it simple enough to charge off the iMac. Generally, the problem is the number of USB-C ports on my 2019 MacBook Pro, which is two, and the fact they are both USB-C and that one is required for charging.  The solution  The TwelveSouth StayGo is a small footprint, light weight, all-aluminum USB-C hub. For my problems, it’s a brilliant solution. The StayGo includes 3 USB-A 3.0 ports (one of which is a SuperSpeed with BC 1.2 7.5W Fast Charge), 10/100/1000 ethernet port, 4K HDMI output, SD and Micro-SD card slits, all with passthrough 85W USB-C capabilities.     For the struggling Wi-Fi, my poor iMac had to downgrade from gigabit hardwire to wireless. Now that I have the StayGo, I can get gigabit hardwire directly to my MacBook Pro. Perfect!  For the external monitor, I can now utilize a high speed 4k enabled HDMI cable, which I happened to have laying around with my Raspberry Pi, which was also velcro’ed under my desk. Now, I can pop the USB-C to HDMI cable back into my iMac. This allows me to have both the iMac and MacBook Pro always hooked up to the external; so I’m only one input selection away from being dual monitors for either machine.     Power is also delivered over the StayGo. The MBPro brick and Apple supplied USB-C cable feed the hub. A one-meter USB-C to USB-C cable with Power Delivery comes with the StayGo to ensure you aren’t losing any juice on the way to your MacBook Pro. To touch on the included cable, I like “L” tipped USB-C that connects to your Mac, so it plugs in, then routes directly behind your machine. As a bonus, the hub has a hidden three-ish-inch travel-sized USB-C to USB-C cable, tucked inside the hub. Pop it out when you are on the road to keep up the same great at-home connections.  The three USB-A connections allow me to use older devices to connect up to the MacBook Pro as well.  Conclusion  The StayGo eliminated all of my WFH problems and I appreciate Twelve South giving me the unit for this review! It is a great addition to my arsenal. I can now just plug in a single cable to my MBPro and get all kinds of functionality it was previously lacking, hardwire internet being of paramount importance.  If there is missing I/O, I would ask for another USB-C port. There are updated accessories like drives and even headphones that have upgraded to USB-C. The two existing USB-C ports are reserved for power input from your charger and USB-C out to the desktop. It would be great if it could even support video out via USB-C.     Most importantly, I am hardwired with gigabit ethernet and I have a single cable keeping me productive. I like that when I return to work, I can tuck this little guy in my day bag, if necessary, as it is only .59″ high, 5″ wide, and 2.44″ deep, weighing 4.7oz.  Because of the small footprint, it is easy to velcro or tack under my standing desk or mount behind my iMac (more on that later).  The hidden travel sized USB-C to USB-C cable is a genius addition.  At $99 it is not an impulse buy, but I do find it fairly consistent with the going rate for the amount of functionality. Consider, especially, it comes with lots of I/O, including dedicated card readers, and two USB-C cables, one of which hides away in the housing for easy travel. It is well designed and comes in durable aluminum.   Check the Twelve South StayGo USB-C hub price on Amazon	NotNews

Trial Over Felon Voting Rights Kicks Off in Florida  27 Apr 2020, 20:40 by ALEX PICKETT  A federal trial began Monday over whether Florida can deny the right to vote for felons unable to pay court costs, restitution or fin es.    Betty Riddle of Sarasota, Fla., holds the T-shirt she wore on March 17, 2020, when she voted for the first time. She was barred from voting in Florida until a federal judge temporarily blocked the state from preventing her and 16 other felons from voting because of unpaid legal financial obligations. (Courtesy of Rickie Riddle via AP)   TALLAHASSEE, Fla. (CN) – When Florida voters passed a constitutional amendment giving the right to vote to most felons in 2018, Latoya Moreland felt deeply moved. Finally, seven years after finishing a probation sentence for drug possession, the 39-year-old could join her adult children and vote.  But a few months after registering to vote, the Manatee County Supervisor of Elections sent Moreland a letter stating $645 in court fines would prevent her from voting.  “I was discouraged, I was sad,” Moreland told a Tallahassee federal court on Monday via virtual conferencing. “I ripped [the letter] up.”  “I’m on a fixed income and I don’t even have enough to cover my bills to help my family,” she said. “If I had the money, I would pay it.”  Moreland is one of 17 plaintiffs who brought a federal lawsuit against state officials over SB 7066 , a law requiring felons to pay all restitution, fines and fees before they are eligible to vote.  Republican lawmakers passed the controversial measure last year, just months after Florida voters overwhelming approved Amendment 4, a constitutional amendment restoring voting rights to most felons “after they complete all terms of their sentence including parole or probation.” The amendment did not mention restitution or fines.  The case being heard Monday, Jones v. DeSantis , could have lasting implications for politics statewide and nationally.  More than 774,000 felons have some type of legal financial obligation, according to a study submitted to the court.  The last two gubernatorial elections in Florida were decided by 1 percentage point. In the 2016 presidential election, Donald Trump took the state with less than 120,000 votes.  In opening statements Monday, attorneys for the felons argued SB 7066 disproportionately affects minorities and the poor.  “The Florida Legislature and governor knew just what they were doing to black Floridians and did it anyway,” said Sean Morales-Doyle with the Brennan Center for Justice in New York.  The plaintiffs’ attorneys also contended felons must navigate a convoluted legal system to even find out how much they owe.  Florida does not have a statewide database for elections officials to check if felons paid all their fines and restitution. Some county elections supervisors have urged felons to register, even if they are unsure whether they owe anything.  “They didn’t just put a price tag on voting, they created a system where the voter does not what the price tag is,” Morales-Doyle said.  But Florida voters knew felons must pay all fines and fees for voting eligibility when they passed Amendment 4, attorneys for Governor Ron DeSantis, Secretary of State Laurel Lee and several supervisors of elections told the court.  “The ‘all terms of a sentence’ language is clear,” Mohammad Jazil of the Tallahassee firm Hopping Green & Sams told the court. “That language is unambiguous.”  Jazil argued felons have other ways to overcome their financial obligations and vote, including petitioning a court to convert the fines to community service hours, asking a collections company or victim to forgive the debts, or seeking full clemency through the state.  “The system is not perfect, but the system gets it right most of the time,” Jazil said.  Last week, state elections officials unveiled new procedures to check voting rolls for felons who owe outstanding restitution, fines and fees.  Daniel Smith, a political science professor from the University of Florida, called the new process “a hot mess.”  “I shudder to think about what’s going to happen in a state with a long and sordid history of database matching,” Smith testified Monday. “There is going to be a tremendous amount of false positives and false negatives. I have grave concerns about individuals not being able to vote who should be able to vote.”  The American Civil Liberties Union, Campaign Legal Center and other criminal justice groups brought the case on behalf of the plaintiffs last summer.  In October, U.S. District Judge Robert Hinkle of the Northern District of Florida issued an injunction blocking the law for the 17 plaintiffs in the case. In February, the 11th Circuit upheld the injunction and later denied the state’s request for an en banc rehearing.  Earlier this month, Hinkle, a Bill Clinton appointee, signaled any decision on the case will apply to all affected felons in Florida, not just the 17 plaintiffs protected by the initial injunction.  At the end of her testimony, Moreland said she wanted the chance to join her daughter and vote in the November election.  “So many people fought, so many people died, so much blood was shed for people to be able to vote,” she said.

Japanese healing helps to destress Bolivia's coronavirus workers  27 Apr 2020, 20:25 by Monica Machicao  LA PAZ (Reuters) - On Bolivia’s frontline against the coronavirus, Marcia Calderon is helping medical workers unwind with energy healing technique Reiki, but without the usual laying on of hands to guard against infection.  Calderon, who began studying the practice two decades ago to work with patients, now does in-person and distance sessions for health workers at a hospital clinic in La Paz.  Reiki, which originated in Japan, is aimed at stimulating a person’s natural healing abilities by channeling “life force energy” through the body. Practitioners place their hands directly on or just above a person to relieve stress and support recovery from illness.  “The context obviously changed about a month ago. We saw the need for doctors to be balanced in order to attend to patients who might come to the hospital,” Calderon said in an interview.  “If their emotions are out of place, everything that creates tension and disharmony with them can also be passed on to the patient.”  Combining Reiki with western medicine is an idea that Calderon considered with her father, a doctor, 15 years ago.  “We discussed the importance of addressing all parts of being - of the body, mind and soul, and he said that Reiki is complementary to allopathic health,” said Calderon, who is also teaching hospital workers to meditate.  In the clinic where she works, two COVID-19 patients died, leaving doctors and nurses depressed and fearful of contracting the infection themselves, she said.  Patricia Callispieris, a director at the clinic, said Reiki has helped to relieve the tensions.  “I feel better. Stronger, with greater understanding,” she said. “It’s as if some weight has been lifted a little and I can walk a little lighter and understand that this is something that we have to get used to.”  Reporting by Monica Machicao and Kristin Neubauer; Writing by Adam Jourdan; Editing by Richard Chang	News
Coronavirus outbreak  Grieving NHS families say £60,000 cannot make up for loss  Relatives of staff who died of virus welcome new payouts but warn focus must be on PPE  27 Apr 2020, 20:23 by Sarah Marsh    Coronavirus – latest updates    See all our coronavirus coverage    Grieving families of NHS and social care workers who died after contracting coronavirus in the course of their duties will be entitled to a £60,000 payment , ministers announced on Monday as the reported death toll for frontline workers rose to 134.  The health and social care secretary, Matt Hancock , said families will receive the payment as part of a “life assurance scheme” and expressed a “deep personal sense of duty” to care for their relatives.  Amid criticism over the failure to provide frontline workers with adequate personal protective equipment (PPE) and testing, he admitted that “nothing replaces the loss of a loved one”.  Relatives of those who have died welcomed the money but said it would not make up for their loss, and warned it should not distract from the need to protect those working alongside coronavirus patients.  They added a hope that the new scheme would be easily accessed and open to everyone, and that the government would value NHS workers more in future.  Michael Tun, whose father Dr Peter Tun, a neuro rehabilitation specialist at the Royal Berkshire hospital in Reading who died aged 62 after contracting coronavirus , said: “I would rather have my dad than the money”.  He added: “These new payments are welcome. And I’m sure they will help a lot of families. But they shouldn’t distract from the key issues around PPE, including the continuing shortages - real attention should be given to that - the distribution of it and how the guidelines are formed, followed and interpreted [by hospitals].  “There needs to be accountability over the guidelines. I would rather have my dad than the money, absolutely, 100%.”    Michael Tun, son of Dr Peter Tun, the NHS doctor who died of coronavirus after he tried in vain to get proper PPE for himself and his team. Photograph: David Levene/The Guardian   Intisar Chowdhury, the son of Abdul Mabud Chowdhury, a consultant urologist who died aged 53 at Queen’s Hospital in Romford, east London, after warning the prime minister over the lack of PPE, said: “While my family and I really do appreciate the government’s efforts to help out the families of loved ones that have died in the pandemic, it doesn’t cover up the fact that there haven’t been neither public nor private apologies in which politicians have acknowledged they have made a mistake in handling the response to the virus.  “None of us are expecting perfection from politicians: we’re just expecting progression, meaning mistakes are completely acceptable - as long as they acknowledge them, apologise for them and learn from them.”  Amal El-Hawrani, the youngest sibling of Amged El-Hawrani, a 55-year-old ENT consultant from Queen’s Hospital in Burton who died from coronavirus, said: “We welcome the initiative. It is more relevant to my sister in-law and nephew who don’t want to speak to the media but on their behalf would welcome any contribution from the government to recognise the sacrifice loved ones made not just now but throughout whole time working for the NHS.”  He added: “But what is more important is that the government appreciate doctors and nurses going forward. They have had a hard time for the last 15-20 years – they had a 1% cap on [the] limit for salaries, and they tried to lift that and the current government voted against that. There is nothing more noble than what they do, everything for [the] benefit of others, but so harshly treated … We hope to see something long-term for their benefit, large increases in their salaries.”  There were also worries about the scheme. The family of Donald Suelto, 51, who died alone after treating a patient infected with coronavirus at Hammersmith hospital in London, said that they hope they would qualify despite failing to get his death certificate.  “We can prove Donald died of Covid-19 but we are struggling at the moment to get his death certificate,” said Ian Robertson, the husband of Suelto’s niece Emylene Suelto Robertson. “I fear the government will make it hard for people to prove they deserve the money, there will be some nurses who died in the community who will not get the £60,000. I am not trying to be negative. It’s good but I am worried it will be hard for families to get it.”  Hancock said that 82 NHS workers and 16 social care staff have died during the pandemic. A Guardian count has recorded 119 deaths of health professionals while Nursing Notes, a platform run by nurses for others in the profession, has found that at least 134 health and care workers have died of coronavirus.  The website has been recording all deaths since the outbreak began, verifying all the information they receive using a number of independent sources and permissions sought from family, friends or colleagues.  Hancock has repeatedly been challenged over whether frontline workers have adequate PPE to prevent them from contracting the disease.  Speaking at the daily Downing Street press conference, where he announced an increase of 360 in the number of hospital deaths from the virus, Hancock said the NHS had been able to make treatment available to everyone who needed it, throughout the crisis.  He said the government wanted to do “everything that we can” to support families dealing with bereavement. “I feel a deep personal sense of duty that we must care for their loved ones.” He added: “We are also looking at which other groups of key workers that applies to who don’t have a scheme already in place.”  Donna Kinnair, chief executive and general secretary of the Royal College of Nursing (RCN), said: “No amount of cash can make up for a family member who passes away but financial security should never add to the worries of those in grief.  “The RCN and other health unions fought for this government announcement and we will examine the detail closely. It must be easily accessed, open to those in social care and primary care too and be paid promptly – no family should face a lengthy or complex process.”  Shadow health minister Justin Madders said: “It is welcome that the government has listened to workforce representatives and ensured that death-in-service benefits are available to everyone working in the NHS and social care sector.  “Now the government must finally get a grip over PPE supplies so that NHS and care staff aren’t putting their lives on the line to do their job and protect the rest of us.”	News
FIFA proposes five substitutes per match when football resumes  27 Apr 2020, 18:36 by Agency Report  FIFA said on Monday it is proposing five substitutions per match when football resumes, to help players cope with the increase in the number of games.  The world governing body has sent its proposal to the International Board (IFAB), the guardian of the laws of the game, which has to approve it before it can be implemented by national leagues, a FIFA spokesman said.  “When the competition resumes, the calendars will be overloaded with a higher than usual number of matches,” he said.  “The safety of the players is one of FIFA’s priorities. One of the concerns is that the high frequency of matches may increase the potential risk of injuries,” he added.  To address these concerns, FIFA has made a proposal to the IFAB to “temporarily relax Law 3 of the game to allow for a greater number of substitutions. Each team could make five substitutions during regulation time plus a sixth substitution during overtime.”  The proposal would need to be studied quickly by the IFAB as some leagues are planning to resume after stopping play because of the coronavirus pandemic in early May.  The measure could remain in force throughout the 2020-2021 season and also apply “in theory” during next summer’s European championships, according to a source close to FIFA.  “If this measure is validated by the board, each league and each body will be able to decide whether or not to apply it and in the competitions of its choice,” added the FIFA spokesman.

Leading Pakistani cleric slammed for blaming pandemic on women   27 Apr 2020, 18:49   LONDON: Britain is examining whether there is a link between an inflammatory disease which severely affects children and COVID-19, a health official said on Monday, adding that it was too soon to say whether there was a link between the two. Health minister Matt Hancock said he was “very worried” about reports of children struggling with severe symptoms that might have a link to COVID-19. “We have become aware in the last few days of reports of severe illness in children which might be a Kawasaki-like disease,” Stephen Powis, national medical director for England, said, referring to a syndrome which causes inflammation of blood vessels, adding that the disease was very rare. “I’ve asked the national clinic director for children and young people to look into this as a matter of urgency... We’re not sure at the moment. It’s really too early to say whether there is a link.”	News

‘What diet will help me reduce hairfall?’  This week, nutritionist Lovneet Batra answers our readers’ queries   27 Apr 2020, 11:27   I’m a student preparing for an entrance examination. Over the past two weeks, I have been feeling exhausted, with body pain in the legs, shoulder and neck. What foods can I eat to help me?  The stress of studying, along with long hours of sitting, can result in body pain and loss of energy. This can get worse if you live in a city with high humidity or during rainy weather. To combat this, focus on magnesium-rich foods that can reduce muscle fatigue and even serve as natural muscle relaxants, such as pumpkin seeds (1 tbsp), rajma , chana , peanuts and coconut water. Aim to walk and stretch one minute for every 30 minutes you are sitting, to reduce the pain. Watch out for incorrect sitting posture while studying.  I am from Lucknow and have recently shifted to Delhi. I live alone in a rented house and have a very hectic study schedule and an erratic eating pattern. Over the last six months, I have had severe hairfall. Could my diet be causing this problem?  Various factors can trigger hairfall, which include a nutrient-deficient diet, stress, and water quality. Here’s a list of nutrients with their sources that can help in reversing excessive hairfall:  Vitamin A: It helps in hair cell growth. Include pumpkin, carrots, sweet potato, spinach, milk or yoghurt.  Vitamin C: It helps in making collagen — an important part of hair structure, and helps in iron absorption, a mineral necessary for good hair. Get your daily dose from amla , lemon, bell peppers, guava or strawberries.  Biotin: Best-known vitamins for hair growth can be easily found in almonds, cauliflower, mushrooms, eggs and wheat bran.  Iron: An iron deficiency can accelerate hair loss. Get it in roasted chana , amaranth chikki or laddoo , peas, rajma , chickpeas and cashews.  Zinc: It plays an important role in hair tissue growth and repair. Load up on dals , dalia and pumpkin seeds to get adequate amounts.  Protein: No matter how many vitamins and minerals you are able to get, unless you’re eating enough protein you cannot combat hairfall. Hair is made of protein, and to get enough raw material you must choose at least three different proteins to include in your daily diet: yoghurt, milk, egg, lentils, chicken, fish, or paneer .  Lovneet Batra  is a nutritionist, a member of the Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics, USA; lecturer at IHM Pusa; a consultant to the Sports Authority of India, having counselled the Indian boxing, gymnastics, cycling and archery teams; and a consultant at Fortis La Femme Hospital, Delhi   Nothing in this column is intended to be, and is not, a substitute for professional medical advice, diagnosis, or treatment.

Player ‘destined’ for England move – Leicester City the ‘most serious team’  27 Apr 2020, 16:40 by Nihat Emre Kocaaslan  Greek newspaper FOS claim Olympiacos left-back Kostas Tsimikas is ‘destined’ for a move to England, despite reported interest from Napoli and Inter Milan.  It’s reported the two Italian sides aren’t willing to pay more than €13m for the Greek defender, with Napoli said to be dropping their interest because of Olympiacos’ asking price.  According to FOS, Inter Milan have other options in mind such as Chelsea’s Marcos Alonso and Emerson, and this will make Leicester City ‘the most serious team’ who want to land Tsimikas this summer.  FOS say along with Leicester City, Liverpool are also interested in signing the 23 year old but they only see him as a backup to Andy Robertson. Subsequently the Merseyside club are looking at alternatives to the Greek international.  The Greek newspaper report Leicester City’s interest is ‘legitimate’ and the Foxes right now are the only club who are seriously interested in signing Tsimikas.  The 23 year old has made 37 appearances for Pedro Martins’ side this season and made 7 assists. His contract with Erythrolefki will expire at the end of June 2022.   RELATED ARTICLES	News

How the Ford Mustang went from a cheap thrill to the world’s best-selling sports car in 6 decades  27 Apr 2020, 16:06 by Kristen Lee, Business Insider US    Ford Mustang Shelby GT500. Ford     The Ford Mustang debuted in 1964 as a sporty and cheap car for younger buyers.    Throughout the years, the Mustang has undergone many changes.    But the original “pony car” philosophy still holds true, even nearly six decades later.   Visit Business Insider’s homepage for more stories .   Nearly 60 years have passed since the birth of the Ford Mustang. In the decades since, the car has gone through six generations and is currently leading global sales for the two-door sports car segment .  Six decades is a long time for a car to be around, but the Mustang still hasn’t lost its reputation of bringing fun and performance to the masses. Originally conceived as an affordable sports car, contemporary Mustangs haven’t really strayed far from that philosophy. They’re still relatively inexpensive for the performance you get in return.  The “pony car” class also originated from the Mustang, but isn’t reserved exclusively for it. The Mustang was a revolution when it launched because it was aimed at the youths, and was compact, sporty, and – most importantly – cheap, as Car Throttle explains. Competitors, such as the Chevrolet Camaro and the Plymouth Barracuda, sprang up not long after.  The Mustang nameplate has undergone plenty of changes throughout the years, despite maintaining the same sentiment: fun and affordable. Here are some of the notable ones that brought us to the current lineup.   On April 17, 1964, Henry Ford II officially unveiled the Ford Mustang at the World’s Fair in Flushing Meadows, New York.    The Mustang was introduced at the World’s Fair in 1964. Ford    Ford called the Mustang a “working man’s Thunderbird.” It cost around $2,300.    The Mustang was introduced at the World’s Fair in 1964. Ford    Some say the Mustang was named after a World War II fighter plane, while others take the horse logo to heart. There was even a weird theory around the Southern Methodist University Mustangs football team.  1965 Ford Mustang coupe prototype.

A heavily modified racing version of the Ford Mustang, the Boss is a vintage Mustang at its finest.    1969 Ford Mustang Boss 302. Ford    Based on the Ford Pinto platform, the 1970s Mustang II was compact compared to the midsize models that came before it. Many fans consider it an illegitimate Mustang. The special “King Cobra” version had a very limited run of just 4,313 units.    1978 Ford Mustang II King Cobra. Ford    The generation of the Fox-body Mustang came between 1979 and 1993. This one is pretty polarizing among Mustang enthusiasts, too.    1987 Ford Mustang GT convertible. Ford    The fourth-generation Mustang won Motor Trend’s 1994 Car of the Year award.

Ford    The sixth-gen Mustang also ditched its traditional use of a solid live rear axle — a suspension system that is praised for being able to handle massive amounts of power, cheaply.    2018 Ford Mustang. Ford    The solid live rear axle is one physical axle connecting both rear wheels. If one wheel hits a bump, the other wheel will also move.    2018 Ford Mustang GT coupe. Ford    It wasn’t always the best at handling.    2019 Ford Mustang. Ford    The current Mustang now uses an independent rear suspension system, which means each wheel on the same axle can respond to the road independently of the others. That improves ride quality and handling.    Ford Mustang Shelby GT500. Ford    Other current special-edition Mustangs include the Bullitt, which is a tribute to Steve McQueen’s “Bullitt” action thriller.    Ford Mustang Bullitt. Ford    There’s also the Ford Mustang Shelby GT350 and GT350R — incredible, track-focused stars for well under the price of a comparable European sports car.    Ford Mustang Shelby GT350R. Ford    And finally, a return of the Ford Mustang’s big nasty: the Shelby GT500. A car with 760 horsepower you or I could easily walk down to a dealership and buy. That’s what America is all about.    Ford Mustang Shelby GT500. Ford	NotNews
"Google's New Pixel Buds Can be Bought Now, Just Not Here  27 Apr 2020, 16:35 by Tom Pritchard  After the companion app hit Google Play and basically screamed to the world that the new wireless Pixel Buds were coming, Google has officially put them on sale . In America. So after waiting six months , Google won't let us buy a pair for ourselves here in the UK. Pfft.  The new Pixel Buds are totally wireless, and don't include the braided connection cord of the original, and come with an in-ear design that's bound to be a thousand times better than the crappy design from the original. Plus they come with features like fast pairing with Pixel devices, adaptive sound, hands-free Google Assistant, real-time translation (via Assistant), find my device support, and so on.  Google promises the buds get five hours of battery on their own, and up to 19 hours from a fully charged charging case  Andf they cost $179 in the States, which suggests something around £170 for us here in the UK - because that's how these things go. That's if they ever make it here, of course, because Google is keeping them in the USA for the time being. Apparently they'll be coming to other countries ""in the coming months"" which is spectacularly unhelpful. Maybe it has something to do with logistics issues caused by coronavirus? The damn bug has affected everything else so far.  And if you try and navigate to the UK product page directly, Google just has a scrolling animation and a button to join the waiting list.  At least that gives Google time to prepare the other colours, because right now Americans can only order the buds in white. Mint Green, Black, and Orange are another ""in the coming months"" deal."

The Post’s Steve Serby is 2020’s most accurate NFL mock drafter  27 Apr 2020, 17:47 by Samantha Previte  Longtime New York Post football columnist Steve Serby has been named 2020’s most accurate prognosticator among over 200 experts, with his record-shattering NFL mock draft.  The website Fantasy Pros scored and ranked mock drafts from industry titans across the internet, awarding points based on player draft order, positional order, and team selections. Out of a possible 320 points, Serby racked up 203 points, seven more than the No. 2 finisher.  “Steve Serby from the New York Post put together an incredible mock draft for our first 200-point score ever,” the Fantasy Pros staff wrote. “He managed to score in the top five of all four categories, including having the best score in two of them. He tied for the lead at projecting each player’s draft spot, and stood alone as the only expert to correctly predict the team/position paring for 23 of 32 possible picks.”  “Beginner’s luck,” he tweeted jokingly in response .  Serby, who has been with The Post for 40-plus years, did six mock drafts this year beginning in January. Only the most recent one, which was published on the morning of Day 1 of the NFL Draft, was entered in the contest.  “11 direct hits in this mock draft is my personal record,” he said.  Serby nailed the first three picks: Joe Burrow (QB, CIN), Chase Young (DE, WAS), and Jeff Okudah (CB, DET) and correctly predicted the Giants would take a tackle to fix their struggling offensive line at No. 4. He also correctly predicted the other three quarterback-team permutations — Tua Tagovailoa to the Dolphins, Justin Herbert to the Chargers and nfl even Jordan Love to the Packers.  Fantasy Pros says this year’s draft was easier to predict than in past years due in part to the dearth of first-round trades. The median score this year was 156, compared with 137 in 2019 and 135 in 2018.  Still, Serby faced tough competition this year stacked up against 212 draft experts , the site’s biggest pool of mock drafts to date. He edged out Nate Bouda of NFL Trade Rumors at No. 2 (196 points), Jason Pruett of DraftPlex at No. 3 (194 points), Albert Breer of The MMQB at No. 4 (193 points) and Jared Smola of Draft Sharks at No. 5 (190 points).

Nearly A Quarter Of NYC Residents Show COVID-19 Antibodies, Cuomo’s Survey Suggests   27 Apr 2020, 17:30   New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo (D) on Monday noted an increase in New York City residents who tested positive for the presence of COVID-19 antibodies in recent days. According to state survey data that he described at a press conference, nearly a quarter of Big Apple residents showed signs of an immune response to the disease.  Crucially, the antibody test used by the state isn’t the same as other tests that show if someone is currently infected with the virus. Rather, the presence of antibodies reflects the past presence of the disease and subsequent immune response.  At a press conference last week , the governor said 21.2% of New York City residents tested had shown antibodies for the disease. On Monday, that number was up to 24.7%. New statewide results described by the governor on Monday showed a percentage point increase to 14.9%, but the governor said that was within the study’s margin of error.  Announcing the initial antibody survey results on Thursday last week, Cuomo said 3,000 adults had been tested outside of grocery stores and other big box stores around the state. On Monday, he said a total of 7,500 people had been tested.  Cuomo also described a jump between the two phases of the study among Hispanic and Latino New Yorkers.  While 22.5% of Hispanic/Latino New Yorkers had tested positive for COVID-19 antibodies as of April 22, when the governor had shared weighted survey results , 32% of the same demographic had tested positive by April 27, Cuomo said, a nearly 10 point jump.  “Nobody can explain what caused that jump,” Cuomo said, before noting that the state was expanding testing in lower-income, African American and Latino neighborhoods.  The number of black New Yorkers who tested positive for COVID-19 antibodies decreased five points between the two rounds of testing, from 21.1% to 16.9%, Cuomo said. Mortality data from the state shows that black and Hispanic New Yorkers have disproportionately died from COVID-19.  But key data are still missing: The state has not released the numbers behind the governor’s press briefing slide shows, which are based on preliminary results. A spokesperson for Cuomo told TPM Thursday that there was “no set timeline” to release more details of the survey.  The antibody tests, which use blood samples, have been received with some caution by public health authorities.  The World Health Organization, for example, said Friday that “Laboratory tests that detect antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 in people, including rapid immunodiagnostic tests, need further validation to determine their accuracy and reliability.”  The New York survey’s focus on grocery and big box stores may also skew numbers higher, by sampling people who are shopping in public rather than staying home.  Nonetheless, Cuomo asserted Monday that the tests provided “snapshots” of the disease’s presence in New York.  “Snapshot, snapshot, snapshot,” he said. “You look at the different pictures and you have a movie.”	News
Egypt tech firm aids virus fight with 3D-printed face shields   27 Apr 2020, 17:57   LONDON: The killing of Iranian Maj. Gen. Qassem Soleimani and the lack of dollars have derailed Tehran’s regional proxy machine, which will need time to recover, the editor in chief of Al Arabiya English said at a webinar on Monday. “The Iranian regime needs US dollars to fund dozens and dozens of militias in Iraq. Many of them it exercises full control over, others a considerable amount — same in Syria and Lebanon,” said Mohammed Khalid Alyahya.  The lack of a charismatic leader to replace Soleimani, the commander of Iran’s Quds Force who was killed in a US drone strike in Iraq in January, is derailing the proxy machine even further, Alyahya added. “In the region, limiting Iran’s ability to fund its proxy network is the strategy. The US strategy is working. It’s not perfect, but it’s working,” he said. “What we’re seeing right now is the maximum-pressure campaign putting Iran in a corner scrambling for resources.”  Alyahya noted that none of the regional actors had a say in the talks that led to the Iran nuclear deal. “Every country within range of Iran’s ballistic missiles, long range or short, or that contains militias, which are many in the region, wasn’t included in the nuclear negotiations,” he said.  “Those most at risk from Iranian aggression and expansionism were an afterthought of the discussions,” he added. “Since the deal, Iran stepped up its activities across the region, doubled down on ethnic cleansing and genocide in Syria … and empowered Hezbollah.” On Saudi-Iranian relations, Alyahya said: “If you go to Riyadh and ask what their biggest national security threat is, invariably you’d hear Iran. However, if you were to go to Iran to ask them what their biggest national security threat is, they’d say the US or Israel, or both …  So primarily it’s a conflict between the US and Iran.” The webinar was hosted by the Harvard Kennedy School’s Belfer Center for Science and International Affairs, and was co-sponsored by Managing the Atom, the Iran Working Group and the Middle East Initiative.

‘Americans are right to be skeptical of this’: Coronavirus contact tracing could threaten privacy, employment, and health resources say some experts  27 Apr 2020, 17:19 by Isaac Scher, Business Insider US     Andrea Ronchini/NurPhoto via Getty Images     Lawmakers and other experts warn that a surveillance system for tracing coronavirus exposure poses serious ethical and potentially legal problems.  Earlier in April, Apple and Google announced a new smartphone application for contact tracing, which will be voluntary.  But “Americans are right to be skeptical of this project,” said Sen. Josh Hawley, a Missouri Republican.  Visit Business Insider’s homepage for more stories .   In the United States, the coronavirus “curve” has not yet flattened. Even so, some officials, business owners, and workers are anxious to restart the economy. Major tech rivals Apple and Google have proposed a solution, seeking to thread the needle between public health and economic activity by deploying a contact-tracing system.  The system, which could be implemented by mid-May, will use smartphone Bluetooth capabilities to track and alert people who have come in contact with a COVID-positive person.  Although the application will not be compulsory, according to the Silicon Valley giants, lawmakers and experts across the country are concerned that it is fraught with ethical and legal problems.  “What I am afraid of is some folks in the tech community will use this huge public need as a way to be invasive with private data and create a beachfront in the health sector,” Sen. Mark R. Warner (D-VA), himself a tech entrepreneur, told the Los Angeles Times .  “It is not like the big platforms are coming at this with clean hands,” Warner added, alluding to the tech industry’s tendentious record on data collection and surveillance .  Apple and Google are keen to allay fears about the industry’s practices, however, and experts like Michael Veale, a professor of digital rights and regulation at University College London, have lauded the companies’ decision to make the virus-surveillance system voluntary.  “This is a very effective power play in favor of privacy by Apple and Google,” Veale told the Wall Street Journal . “They have made a very conscious decision against very centralized databases, while still giving epidemiologists the data they need.”  “It is a trivial intrusion on our liberty as citizens when you compare it to all the other things during this pandemic where we have said, ‘This is necessary, we will do it,'” Stewart Baker, assistant secretary of Homeland Security under George W. Bush, told the Los Angeles Times.    A visualization of what COVID-19 contact tracing would look like. Getty Images   Employment, smartphone ownership, and privacy rights come to the fore  Even so, “Americans are right to be skeptical of this project,” said Sen. Josh Hawley, a Missouri Republican.  “Too often, Americans have been burned by companies who calculated that the profits they could gain by reversing privacy pledges would outweigh any later financial penalty,” he wrote in a letter to the CEOs of Apple and Google’s parent company, Alphabet, last week.  He challenged them to demonstrate their intentions by claiming personal responsibility for the surveillance application.  “If you seek to assure the public, make your stake in this project personal,” he said. “Make a commitment that you and other executives will be personally liable if you stop protecting privacy, such as by granting advertising companies access to the interface once the pandemic is over.”  The application will only be used during the pandemic, the companies said. But it’s unclear when the health emergency will be over. Social distancing could be necessary “into 2022,” according to Harvard University researchers , and “a resurgence in contagion could be possible as late as 2024.”  Even if the application is voluntary now, some fear it could become a condition of employment, according to Ashkan Soltani, the Federal Trade Commission’s chief technologist during the Barack Obama administration.  Soltani worried about the possibility that employers would be alerted to “whether you have been in contact with someone who has been infected,” Soltani told the Los Angeles Times .  Other issues abound. Poor people, elderly people, black Americans, and Hispanics are all disproportionately likely not to own a smartphone, according to the Pew Research Center, preventing them from being counted in the contact tracing project.  Heavy reliance on a system requiring smartphone ownership could overlook potential hot spots where fewer people own the devices. Discrimination could be baked into the system, the ACLU warned in a white paper released earlier this month.  Others, like privacy researcher Maciej Cegłowski, acknowledge the risks of a surveillance application, while emphasizing the urgency of the pandemic.  “The terrifying surveillance infrastructure this project requires exists and is maintained in good working order in the hands of private industry, where it is entirely unregulated and is currently being used to try to sell people skin cream,” wrote Cegłowski . “Why not use it to save lives?”	NotNews
Opponents urge Sizewell C delay during coronavirus crisis  27 Apr 2020, 17:17 by Matthew Earth   Opponents campaigning against a new nuclear reactor at Sizewell have written to the government urging EDF to halt its plans until the coronavirus lockdown has passed.   Councillors from the Liberal Democrat, Green and Independent group at Suffolk County Council wrote to business secretary Alok Sharma over fears EDF will submit a Development Consent Order (DCO) for the Sizewell C project in May.  But EDF said the lengthy application process means it could be six months before the plans can be debated in public, at which point social distancing may have eased.  EDF was originally due to submit a DCO at the end of March, but the move was put back several weeks.  The energy firm is required to submit the order due to the scale and impact of the proposed £14billion third reactor at Sizewell, on the Suffolk coast.  A submission of the documents would trigger a period of formal debate.  But campaigners fear doing so would be inappropriate while social distancing guidelines are in place, preventing discussion of the plans.  The cross-party county councillor group is the latest set of key figures to express their concerns, believing public debate would be “impossible” during the Covid-19 crisis.  Group leader Penny Otton said: “We are very concerned over the ability of stakeholders to fully engage in consultations during the current crisis.  “Professional bodies are coping with staff sickness and redeployment, members of the public are preoccupied with looking after ill friends and relatives or grieving, and local authorities are rightly focusing on keeping residents safe.  “It therefore does not seem appropriate to start a consultation on Sizewell C until social distancing restrictions are lifted.”  However, EDF argues it could be months before the debate period can commence, as the government’s planning inspectorate must examine the proposals before they are made public.  A spokesman said: “It is important to stress that the examination stage of the planning application process is unlikely to commence for approximately five to six months.”   MORE: MP Dan Poulter voices concerns over Sizewell C consent bid during virus crisis    If you value what this story gives you, please consider supporting the East Anglian Daily Times.

Agri work to be started in district’s fallow lands  27 Apr 2020, 17:44 by Staff Reporter  The district panchayat has decided to begin cultivation in the fallow land spread across the district.  The decision was taken at a steering committee meeting on Monday, following Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan’s call to increase agricultural production to achieve self-sufficiency. An action plan has been prepared by the agricultural officers.  According to the district panchayat’s estimates, the district has more than 5,000 acres of land lying fallow. The project aims at turning this into cultivable land and to make the district self-sufficient in vegetable production. Considering the peculiar situation due to the COVID-19 outbreak, 20 plots in 18 grama panchayats, covering an area of 200 acres, have been chosen for farming in the initial stage.  Volunteers in the grama panchayats, Kudumbashree groups, and Haritha Karma Sena members, will be taking up the farming work. Meetings will be held in the panchayats on Tuesday to organise the groups and volunteers for the work. In the initial phase, vegetables, rice, tapioca and plantain will be cultivated. The Deputy Director of agriculture has been given the responsibility of procuring the seeds and saplings.  The second phase of the cultivation in fallow land will be taken up after the lockdown. District panchayat V.K. Madhu appealed to the public to join in the effort.	News
Samsung Galaxy Buds add support for Ambient Sound, Windows 10 Swift Pair   27 Apr 2020, 10:04 by João Carrasqueira  Samsung has released a new software update for the original Galaxy Buds, which debuted last year alongside the Galaxy S10 family. The update brings some new features to the earbuds, including a few that were previously exclusive to the more recent, and more expensive, Galaxy Buds+ .  One of the new features is the ability to to pair the Galaxy Buds more easily with Windows 10 devices. Using Swift Pair, which is available on Windows 10 version 1803 and later, the Galaxy Buds should be detected by your PC automatically once you turn them on. It's also possible to switch between connected devices so the Galaxy Buds can connect to multiple devices.  Another new addition is support for Ambient Sound, which will be on automatically after the update. The feature allows users to hear their surroundings while using the Galaxy Buds, and it can be turned off or on at will, even while using a single earbud at a time.  Finally, the Galaxy Buds can now automatically resume playing music from your Spotify playlist by tapping and holding on one of the earbud. It's also possible to do this gesture again to get recommendations for other playlists. This is available as one of the shortcuts that can be assigned to this gesture, so you'll have to use the Galaxy Wearable app to use it.  The software update is available starting today, and you'll need to be running Android Lollipop or newer to get the update.	News

Safety checks for registration renewals waived temporarily | Honolulu Star-Advertiser   27 Apr 2020, 10:05   Oahu motorists who renew their annual vehicle registration can now do so electronically without a valid safety check at least through May 31.  The state last month announced it would suspend the requirement that vehicle registrations be accompanied by a valid safety check. But the Department of Customer Services needed until April 3 to update its computer programming to no longer require a safety check, so the waiver was initially available only through mail-in registration.  With the recent adjustment in the software, those renewing online also won’t be required to input a valid safety check number, nor will those renewing at one of the six vehicle registration kiosks (at select Safeway and Foodland locations), Customer Services Director Sheri Kajiwara said last week.  The change is one of several made since satellite city halls and driver licensing centers were among the entities shut down in late March in the wake of the coronavirus pandemic. Safety check stations, likewise, were deemed nonessential.  A majority of the transactions typically done at satellite city halls and driver licensing centers can now be handled online, by mail or at the self-serve registration renewal kiosks, Kajiwara said. Among the few exceptions are those seeking a Hawaii driver’s license for the first time or are otherwise requiring road tests. Those transactions require inspectors to be physically in vehicles with the drivers, too close to practice social distancing, she said.  Employees who normally handle counter transactions have been reassigned to assist with processing online driver licensing and motor vehicle registration renewals, and help field what has now grown to between 900 to 1,000 telephone queries daily.  Another recent policy change allows those 72 and older to renew driver’s licenses online, provided their licenses expire sometime in 2020.  Since implementing the change March 24, 632 seniors have renewed their licenses online, Kajiwara said.  In a separate effort to assist people who’ve been inconvenienced, the city is notifying by mail, in the coming weeks, about 60,000 people eligible to obtain a gold star on their driver’s licenses or state ID cards that they can do so online. Those eligible are people who renewed their license after May 2014.  The urgency for those seeking a federally compliant driver’s license has abated since the federal government has extended the REAL ID enforcement date by a year to Oct. 1, 2021.  The temporary shutdowns of the physical customer serv­ices locations have forced people to shift their habits, Kajiwara said.  Vehicle registration transactions used to be conducted 50% online, 45% over the counter and 5% at kiosks. Since the closure of satellite city halls, 75% are now conducted online and 25% at kiosks.  As noted in Kokua Line last week , the city has canceled advance Aloha Q appointments made online, and those will not be restored in the order in which they were canceled.  Instead, appointments during the first month or two following reopening will be reserved for those whose licenses have already expired.  “We’re going to roll out appointments in phases to meet the greatest needs first,” Kajiwara said, acknowledging that this might upset some who’ve made appointments. “If you’re 72 and older, you have another option. If you’re going for the gold star, you have another year.”  Customer Services is starting to gear up for reopening the satellite city halls and driver licensing centers whenever they get the OK from Mayor Kirk Caldwell. A general stay-at-home, work-from-home order was just extended through May 31, but the mayor said he might open some facilities sooner if modifications can be made to reduce the possibility of contracting COVID-19.

Notre Dame Cathedral worksite refitted for virus safety  27 Apr 2020, 10:41 by The Associated Press  PARIS — Workers are refitting the construction site at fire-damaged Notre Dame Cathedral to protect staff from the virus and allow cleanup efforts at the Paris landmark to resume.  More than a year after the blaze, workers still haven’t finished stabilizing the medieval cathedral, much less rebuilding it. And the coronavirus outbreak caused a new setback: Work on the cathedral halted in mid-March, when France imposed strict confinement measures.  On Monday, workers began to re-arrange the construction site to make it virus-safe, according to an official with the state agency overseeing the project. The site is hidden from the public by high barriers.  That includes re-arranging showers and cloakrooms to allow more distance between workers, and installing a place to eat because restaurants in France are currently closed, Notre Dame rector Monsignor Patrick Chauvet told reporters outside the site Monday. He said most workers will stay in nearby vacant hotels so they won’t have to take public transportation.  The cleanup work itself is scheduled to start gradually resuming next week. Chauvet said the priority will be taking down 250 tons of scaffolding that had been installed for a prior renovation project and was badly damaged in the blaze. The unstable scaffolding now endangers the Gothic jewel.  “It’s a difficult job. It requires the climbers to be calm,” Chauvet said. “We can’t have COVID there to cause them stress.”  Despite the delay, the general in charge of the reconstruction said he still wants to stick to ambitious plans to hand the cathedral back to the Catholic Church in 2024, when Paris is set to host the Olympics.  ___  Follow AP news coverage of the coronavirus pandemic at https://apnews.com/VirusOutbreak and https://apnews.com/UnderstandingtheOutbreak  The Associated Press	News
Two bridges connecting old and new city in Ahmedabad shut  According to police, travel by vehicles and on foot on two bridges — Gandhi bridge and Dudheshwar bridge — was stopped since Monday morning to curtail the movement of people even as Ahmedabad recorded 197 new cases in the past 24 hours.  27 Apr 2020, 19:49 by Express News Service  As COVID-19 cases continue to rise in clusters of Ahmedabad, police closed down two bridges connecting the old city to new, in order to curtail the movement of people from one area to another.  According to police, travel by vehicles and on foot on two bridges — Gandhi bridge and Dudheshwar bridge — was stopped since Monday morning to curtail the movement of people even as Ahmedabad recorded 197 new cases in the past 24 hours.  In a video message, Gujarat Director General of Police Shivanand Jha said, “The number of positive cases in Ahmedabad is high so the movement in such places where there are clusters is being restricted including closing of bridges. People are requested to cooperate with the police and ensure self discipline and social distancing . Surveillance is being increased in the cluster areas. If people step out to buy essentials, they must buy commodities for 2-3 days.”  Jha also said that police will take action against such shop owners who would open establishments without permission during lockdown.  “Such shops that have not been given relaxation, if they are found open and operating, then police will take action against the shopkeeper and customers found at spot as well. This is in particular with the pan masala shops, restaurants and eateries,” said Jha.	News
Pentagon declassifies and officially releases three UFO videos - including the infamous 'Tic Tac' clip - taken by US Navy pilots and confirms the aircraft are 'unidentified'  27 Apr 2020, 19:53 by Valerie Edwards For Dailymail.com    Pentagon released footage showing 'unexplained aerial phenomena' on Monday    'The aerial phenomena observed in the videos remain characterized as 'unidentified',' the Department of Defense said in a statement    One video shows 2004 'Tic Tac' incident that was recorded over Pacific Ocean    A second video was captured off the coast of Jacksonville, Florida, in 2015    The Pentagon has officially released three videos taken by US Navy pilots that reportedly show 'unexplained aerial phenomena'.  The footage that had been previously acknowledged as real by the Navy, capture what pilots recorded on their video sensors during training flights in 2004 and 2015.  Two of the clips were first published in 2017 by the New York Times and the third by the To The Stars Academy in 2018 - a group that specializes in unexplained phenomenon and was founded by Blink-182 guitarist Tom DeLonge.  'The Department of Defense has authorized the release of three unclassified Navy videos, one taken in November 2004 and the other two in January 2015, which have been circulating in the public domain after unauthorized releases in 2007 and 2017,' said Susan Gough, a Defense Department spokesperson in a statement.  The statement, released on Monday added that the videos were released after a 'thorough review' which determined that the unclassified videos 'does not reveal any sensitive capabilities or systems, and does not impinge on any subsequent investigations of military air space incursions by unidentified aerial phenomena'.    Official US Navy video shows 'UFO' tracked off East Coast in 2015     One of the videos was captured off the coast of Jacksonville, Florida, in 2015 (pictured)     Startling video of Navy pilots encountering unknown flying object   One of the clips shows the notorious 2004 'Tic Tac' incident that was recorded over the Pacific Ocean. A second video was captured off the coast of Jacksonville, Florida, in 2015.  Several months after those videos were published, To The Stars Academy released an additional video from the 2015 incident, which features a navy pilot remarking: 'What the f**k is that thing?'  DOD officials said they released the videos 'in order to clear up any misconceptions by the public on whether or not the footage that has been circulating was real, or whether or not there is more to the videos'.  'The aerial phenomena observed in the videos remain characterized as 'unidentified,'' the department said.  Former senator, Harry Reid, lauded the Pentagon's decision to officially release the clips.  'I'm glad the Pentagon is finally releasing this footage, but it only scratches the surface of research and materials available,' Reid tweeted Monday.  'The US needs to take a serious, scientific look at this and any potential national security implications. The American people deserve to be informed,' he added.  In September 2019, the Navy confirmed the authenticity of the videos for the first time.    2004 video shows Navy pilot tracking UFO over Pacific     The other video shows the notorious 2004 'Tic Tac' incident (pictured) that was recorded over the Pacific Ocean     Former senator, Harry Reid, lauded the Pentagon's decision to officially release the clips   'The Navy considers the phenomena contained/depicted in those three videos as unidentified,' Navy spokesman Joseph Gradisher told The Black Vault at the time.  The Navy prefers to call the objects seen in the videos 'unexplained aerial phenomena' (UAP), as opposed to the more commonly-used 'unidentified flying object' (UFO).  The clips were first published by The New York Times in December of 2017 and were recorded on two separate occasions.  According to the DOD, the videos have been circulating in the public domain after unauthorized releases in 2007 and 2017.  In June 2019, senators were reportedly briefed by the Pentagon about reports of UFO sightings by Navy pilots.  One of those senators was Mark Warner, of Virginia, the vice chairman of the Senate Intelligence Committee, whose spokesperson said: 'If naval pilots are running into unexplained interference in the air, that's a safety concern Senator Warner believes we need to get to the bottom of,' Politico reported at the time.  The briefing was delivered by the Navy and included staff from the Under Secretary of Defense for Intelligence.  It is understood that such briefings have been on the rise since it was revealed that the Pentagon's secretive Aerospace Threat Identification Program continues to investigate reported sightings of unknown aircraft.   'Tic Tac' UFO: US Navy pilot made visual contact with the object on November 14, 2004  At least six Super Hornet pilots made visual or instrument contact with the UFO on November 14, 2004.  The encounters, which are documented in numerous interviews with first-hand witnesses, remain a mystery, and the object's incredible speed and movements have led to speculation that it was extraterrestrial in origin.  The original FLIR video from the USS Nimitz encounters leaked online as early as 2007.  Witnesses say that clips of the video had been circulated widely on the Navy's intranet - used to communicate between ships in the carrier group - and an unknown sailor in the group likely first leaked it.  The clip became one of the most-touted pieces of evidence in the UFO community when the Pentagon confirmed its authenticity in 2017.  In January, Chad Underwood, the former Navy aviator who shot the famous leaked video clip, broke his silence in an interview with New York Magazine.    Chad Underwood, the former Navy aviator who shot the famous leaked video clip, broke his silence in an interview with New York Magazine in January   He said the oblong, wingless 'Tic Tac' shaped object was spotted off the coast of Mexico over the Pacific.  He also revealed that for about two weeks, the Ticonderoga-class guided missile cruiser USS Princeton, part of Carrier Strike Group 11, had been tracking mysterious aircraft intermittently on an advanced AN/SPY-1B passive radar.  The radar contacts were so inexplicable that the system was even shut down and restarted to to check for bugs - but operators continued to track the unknown aircraft.  Then on November 14, Commander David Fravor says he was flying in an F/A-18F Super Hornet when he made visual contact with the object, which seemed to dive below the water, resurface, and speed out of sight when he tried to approach it.  As Fravor landed on the deck of the Nimitz, Underwood was just gearing up to take off on his own training run.  Fravor told Underwood about the bizarre encounter, and urged Underwood to keep his eyes open.  He recalls how he suddenly saw a blip on his radar before tracking it on his FLIR camera.    Underwood was flying in an F/A-18F Super Hornet as part of the USS Nimitz (above) carrier group when he encountered an 'unidentified aerial phenomena'   'The thing that stood out to me the most was how erratic it was behaving,' Underwood told the magazine.  'And what I mean by 'erratic' is that its changes in altitude, air speed, and aspect were just unlike things that I've ever encountered before flying against other air targets.'  Underwood said the object wasn't obeying the laws of physics and dropped from 50,000 feet altitude to 100 feet in seconds, which he says, 'isn't possible'. He added that he saw no signs of an engine heat plume or any sign of propulsion.  The pilot refuses to speculate as to whether the object is an alien spacecraft or not, however.  'That's not my job. But I saw something. And it was also seen, via eyeballs, by both my commanding officer, Dave Fravor, and the Marine Corps Hornet squadron commanding officer who was out there as well.'

WarnerMedia expands free HBO Max deal to HBO subscribers who pay through Apple’s services  HBO Max will also integrate into the Apple TV app when it launches  27 Apr 2020, 19:03 by Chaim Gartenberg  WarnerMedia and Apple have reached a deal that will give free HBO Max access to existing HBO customers who subscribe to the service through Apple. Free access begins when the new streaming service launches on May 27th, via Deadline .  It’s a change from the original announcement , where AT&T — which owns WarnerMedia, and by extension, HBO Max — said that only customers who subscribe through hbonow.com and are billed directly by HBO would get the additional service. In a similar vein, customers who are billed for HBO through Apple services will also get access to HBO Max now. (Technically, neither of these groups is getting HBO for “free” — customers will still have to pay for their existing HBO or HBO Now subscriptions.)  Apple gets in on free HBO Max for current HBO subscribers  The deal includes both customers who subscribe to HBO Now through an App Store in-app purchase on the iOS version of the streaming app, as well as subscribers to HBO through the Apple TV app’s “Channels” feature.  As part of the agreement, HBO Max will integrate into the Apple TV app when it comes to suggesting content and will offer the option for new subscribers to enroll through Apple’s store — just like with HBO Now.  The new deal appears to apply just to Apple customers, meaning that anyone who subscribes to HBO through a different means — like Amazon Prime — won’t get HBO Max for free, at least for now.    Update April 27th, 8:20pm:   Added additional details about which customers will be getting access to HBO Max through existing HBO subscriptions.	News
Hotels, Airbnb beef up cleaning standards to calm travellers  27 Apr 2020, 19:49 by Dee-Ann Durbin    FILE - In this March 27, 2020, file photo, a downtown hotel leaves lights on in vacant room windows to form a heart in Kansas City, Mo. Hotels and home-sharing companies are beefing up their cleaning efforts in order to soothe jittery travelers. Hospitality companies have been hammered by the new coronavirus. U.S. hotel occupancy is at a historic low, and many hotels worldwide have closed temporarily and furloughed staff. (AP Photo/Charlie Riedel, File)   Hotels and home-sharing companies are beefing up their cleaning efforts in order to soothe jittery travellers.  Hilton said Monday it’s teaming up with RB — which makes Lysol and Dettol disinfectants — and the Mayo Clinic to develop new cleaning procedures that will be in place by June. The news follows Marriott’s announcement last week that it’s creating a cleanliness council to develop new standards. Marriott’s council includes infectious disease specialists and an expert from EcoLab, which makes commercial cleaning products.  Airbnb also said Monday that it’s developing cleaning protocols for its hosts with guidance from former U.S. Surgeon General Dr. Vivek Murthy and EcoLab. Airbnb said starting in May, guests will be able to see if a host commits to Airbnb’s new cleaning protocol, which includes requirements for cleaners to wear masks and use certain disinfectants. As a precaution, hosts will also be required to observe a 24-hour waiting period before booking new guests in a property.  Hospitality companies have been hammered by the new coronavirus. U.S. hotel occupancy is at a historic low, and many hotels worldwide have closed temporarily and furloughed staff. Airbnb has promised $250 million in reimbursements for hosts to help make up for lost business.  As restrictions ease, companies know they need to make guests feel safe.  “There’s always been an expectation that it would be clean, but now the clean has a double exclamation point after it,” said Phil Cordell, senior vice-president and global head of new brand development at Hilton.  Hilton will require franchisees to adopt its new cleaning program, Cordell said. The program will roll out globally to all 6,100 Hilton hotels by the end of May. Cordell said Hilton expects travellers to slowly start returning to its hotels in mid-summer.  In North America, the program will be advertised to consumers as Hilton CleanStay with Lysol. Cordell said Hilton has always used commercial cleaning products, but thought partnering with a well-known consumer brand like Lysol would emphasize how serious it is about cleaning.  Hilton plans to put a seal on the door of a room that has been cleaned and disinfected, so guests know no one else has entered. It’s doing away with pads of paper and pens in the room, and it will close fitness centres more often to wipe them clean. Stations with disinfectant wipes will be added throughout hotels.  Cordell said Hilton anticipates some things will change over time, like requirements that guests sit further apart in dining rooms. But he thinks the new cleaning protocols are here to stay.  “I don’t think it’s a short-term thing. I think it’s a long-term thing,” Cordell said.  Airbnb believes consumers might seek out its shared homes when the virus recedes because they can stay further apart from other guests. The company says as of late March, reservations at least six months out were trending higher than last year.  But unlike hotels, Airbnb could have a harder time enforcing standards at its 7 million listings. The company said hosts who don’t commit to its new cleaning standards can opt for a new feature that will keep their properties empty for longer than 24 hours between stays.	NotNews
"Some NFL players may be misdiagnosed with brain disease  27 Apr 2020, 19:05 by Serena Gordon, HealthDay News  The brain damage that may occur in football players has received a lot of attention in recent years. But a new study suggests that former players who get a diagnosis of chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE) when they're still alive may well be getting the wrong diagnosis.  CTE can only be diagnosed with an autopsy, the researchers explained. Other conditions could cause the symptoms leading to a mistaken CTE diagnosis.  ""There is currently no universally agreed upon way to clinically diagnose a living player, yet our study found that many former players are reporting that they received CTE diagnoses from their medical care providers,"" said the study's lead author, Rachel Grashow. She's a research scientist at the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health, in Boston.  ""This is disconcerting, because there are many other conditions that are very common to football players -- such as sleep apnea, hypertension, obesity, diabetes, use of prescription pain medication -- that can cause cognitive symptoms exactly like those attributed to CTE,"" Grashow explained.  Her team surveyed nearly 4,000 former National Football League (NFL) players and found nearly 3 percent had received a CTE diagnosis.  Grashow said the researchers were concerned that ""clinicians are quick to diagnose CTE."" Instead, she added, doctors should focus on a broad array of possibilities, particularly conditions that can be treated and may improve a player's quality of life.  CTE started to get a lot more attention in 2015 after the family of NFL legend Frank Gifford said he had suffered from mental issues caused by CTE. The brain condition has been linked to repeated head trauma, which can be common in professional football players. CTE is also believed to have contributed to the suicide of retired NFL great Junior Seau at age 43.  The current research included data from the ongoing Football Players Health Study. Investigators surveyed 3,913 former NFL players who played from 1960 or later. In 1960, the league moved from using soft leather helmets to hard plastic.  The players who responded to the researchers were between 24 and 89 years old.  In players under 60, 2.3 percent reported a CTE diagnosis, and 3.7 percent of those over 60 said they had been diagnosed with CTE, according to the report published online April 13 in the Annals of Neurology.  Symptoms of mental impairment, such as difficulty concentrating, forgetfulness and mood changes were more common among the athletes with a CTE diagnosis. And players diagnosed with CTE were more likely than those without the diagnosis to have one or more of these conditions: sleep apnea, abnormal cholesterol, high blood pressure, depression, obesity, heart diseases, low testosterone and prescription pain medicine use.  The ramifications of a possible misdiagnosis are significant, Grashow said. ""Believing that someone has this diagnosis -- currently impossible to confirm during life and for which there are no treatments -- could lead to despair, depression and suicidal thoughts in players,"" she said. ""Such a diagnosis may also encourage passive health behaviors, whereby players stop proactively working to improve their diet, sleep habits and physical activity habits.""  Dr. Ira Goldstein is director of neurotrauma at Rutgers New Jersey Medical School.  ""The biggest worry in saying you have CTE and not something else, is that you may be missing out on an opportunity to treat something else,"" Goldstein said.  ""CTE is not reversible, but there are other conditions that are, like nutritional deficits,"" he said.  Goldstein also noted that there are some brain conditions that can be treated with surgery that mimic CTE symptoms, including tumors and a buildup of fluid in the brain. Another condition that could be mistaken for CTE is vascular dementia. And while that condition can't be reversed, there are treatments, such as controlling blood pressure and taking aspirin to prevent blood clots, that can help prevent it from getting worse, he explained.  Goldstein said researchers are studying new ways to diagnose CTE in people while they're still alive. PET scans, spinal fluid analysis and a blood test that looks for certain substances in the blood are all being evaluated.  Grashow said the researchers hope their study's findings help educate medical providers about the limits and potential consequences in diagnosing CTE in someone living.  ""We also want to empower players and their families to advocate for themselves in medical settings, and push back on clinicians who suggest CTE without exploring other health conditions that affect cognition,"" she said.

Comcast and Verizon extend no-disconnect pledge through June 30th  27 Apr 2020, 21:19 by Jon Fingas  Comcast and Verizon (Engadget’s parent company) are extending their pledges to keep people online as the US grapples with the COVID-19 pandemic. Both providers have announced that their no-disconnect policies will now last through June 30th for home, small business and wireless subscribers. As before, anyone who can’t pay their bills during the period just has to notify the appropriate company to avoid disconnections and late fees.  We’ve asked AT&T and T-Mobile if they’re following suit. Multiple major telecoms adopted the FCC’s Keep Americans Connected pledge in mid-March as the government agency stressed the importance of enabling remote communication for work and school, not to mention to offset the economic impact.  The networks didn’t provide detailed justifications, but Comcast said it had extended its policy to help students “finish out the school year” while staying home. And practically speaking, this is an acknowledgment that many lockdowns won’t lift quickly. Remote work, job seeking and education will likely continue for a while as states and cities reopen, making no-disconnect policies vital until the economy returns to something vaguely resembling normality.  Update 4/27 6:45PM ET: AT&T and T-Mobile also tell Engadget that they have stretched out their policy until June 30th.   Verizon owns Engadget's parent company, Verizon Media. Rest assured, Verizon has no control over our coverage. Engadget remains editorially independent.	News
NBA sets guidelines and timeline for reopening facilities   27 Apr 2020, 21:00   (Reuters) - The National Basketball Association announced on Monday it is modifying guidance on player training, which could allow team facilities to open as early as May 8 in U.S. states easing stay-at-home orders put in place to fight the novel coronavirus outbreak.  The opening of facilities would be the first step towards restarting the league, which has been shuttered since March 11 after a Utah Jazz player tested positive for the coronavirus.  “The purpose of these changes is to allow for safe and controlled environments for players to train in states that allow them to do so, and to create a process for identifying safe training options for players located in other states,” the NBA said in a statement.  The changes would allow teams to make facilities available to players for workouts or injury treatment on a voluntary basis.  For teams based in states or cities where government restrictions remain in place, the NBA will work with them to find alternative arrangement.  As part of the guidelines no more than four players will be permitted at a facility at any one time and no coaches can participate.  Group activity remains prohibited, including practices or scrimmages.  Players are also prohibited from using non-team facilities such as public health clubs, fitness centers or gyms.

"You Knew the Anti-Trump Press Were Going Latch Onto This...And They Got Embarrassed Again  27 Apr 2020, 21:05 by Matt Vespa  Last week, you knew the anti-Trump opposition press was going to latch onto President Trump’s disinfectant remarks. It might not have been the most artful remark. In fact, the only reason why it was a terrible remark is that the liberal media would go ballistic over it, distracting us with their nonsense as we fight his Wuhan coronavirus outbreak. Partially, it wouldn’t shock me if Trump had the latter in mind, given the media’s pervasive tenacity to take everything he says literally. Frankly, I don’t care. Trump is president. They’re not. And given how badly the media has covered this White House, they can be ignored for the next century. Here’s what caused the uproar (via NYT ):  President Trump’s self-assessment has been consistent. “I’m, like, a very smart person,” he assured voters in 2016. “A very stable genius,” he ruled two years later. “I’m not a doctor,” he allowed on Thursday, pointing to his skull inside the White House briefing room, “but I’m, like, a person that has a good you-know-what.” Mr. Trump’s performance that evening, when he suggested that injections of disinfectants into the human body could help combat the coronavirus, did not sound like the work of a doctor, a genius, or a person with a good you-know-what.  More from CBS News :  During the televised briefing, Mr. Trump said he's seen ""the disinfectant where it knocks it [coronavirus] out in a minute."" He continued, ""And is there a way you can do something like that by injection inside or almost a cleaning? As you see, it gets in the lungs and it does a tremendous number on the lungs — so it'll be interesting to check that. ... It sounds interesting to me."" William Bryan, the head of the science and technology office at the Department of Homeland Security, appeared to quickly shoot down the idea. Asked by a reporter, ""There's no scenario that could be injected into a person, is there?"" Bryan replied, ""No.""  Reportedly, Dr. Deborah Birx, one of Trump’s top officials on his Wuhan coronavirus task force, is not happy that the media is still predictably talking about this. Yet, this is something these clowns will zero-in on, trying to find some hook in order to weaponize it against the White House. So, they tried to suggest that hordes of people were poisoning themselves off of Trump’s remarks. That’s fake news (via Reason ):  ...the president suggested that perhaps an ""injection"" of disinfectant could help cure people of COVID-19. Critics of Donald Trump went to town—and rightfully so!—while supporters scrambled to settle on a defense (both ""he didn't really say that"" and ""he did but it was sarcasm"" have been in play). By Saturday morning, social media was  abuzz  with articles  about people  calling  poison control centers , each crafted to illustrate how Americans had apparently taken Trump's ramblings to heart and consumed household disinfectants like Lysol and bleach. The problem? Articles shared as illustrations of this actually said no such thing. One article making the rounds, from the New York Daily News , is headlined "" A spike in New Yorkers ingesting household cleaners following Trump's controversial coronavirus comments ."" But the article makes no mention of anyone deliberately consuming household cleaners. It simply states that 30 people called the city's poison control hotline ""over fears that they had ingested bleach or other household cleaners."" Fearing that you ingested something doesn't jibe with having intentionally consumed that substance. The authors of the Daily News piece , Anna Sanders and Chris Sommerfeldt, try to circumvent this inconvenient fact by noting that over the same time period in 2019, the Poison Control Center ""only handled 13 similar cases."" And while this time, nine calls were about possible Lysol exposure and 10 about bleach, last year's calls contained ""no cases reported about Lysol exposure and only two were specifically in regards to bleach."" The paper doesn't present any other data about calls to Poison Control for comparison. […] But the Daily News piece is far from the only poison-control story being framed misleadingly. A story out of Kentucky that's being shared as ""evidence"" people have been consuming household cleaners following Trump's Thursday statements is actually about calls to Kentucky poison control centers in March .        It’s a swing and a miss again because the media had to overreach. They must attack Trump, who didn’t tell Americans to inject Lysol into their veins. This is the classic case of the isolated incident. Trump mentions, say hydroxychloroquine, as a possible therapeutic as we wait for a vaccine and one couple in Arizona injects something that sounds similar but it’s not hydroxychloroquine , and the media blames Trump. The woman was left in critical condition, while her husband died after they both ingested…fish tank cleaner. You simply cannot make this stuff up. Former CNN Producer Steve Krakauer even admitted that Trump never said we should inject disinfectants into our bloodstream, but he did note the other thing the media should talk about. One is that there should be a more balanced approach to the lockdowns and the re-openings, even though the former saved lives. That being, brace yourselves for the media shaming if there is a slight uptick in new infections. It’s going to happen, but it’s not like this administration said that there would be zero new infections in states that have met the stage one reopening criterion:  One of the storylines I've written abou t is the geographic bias in coverage of coronavirus, and that has continued as we've begun to see some strategic easing of lockdown, stay-at-home orders. While the focus has been on the beaches being populated by what the media perceives as Trump voters, California, for example, reported 50,000 beachgoers in what looked like far more crowded beaches on Friday. But the point here is not to COVID-shame anyone. We need to be smart about how we approach emerging from lockdown. It's all about balance. I've been enjoying following former New York Times reporter Alex Berenson, but I also can' t understand his argument about the effectiveness of the lockdowns. Anyone who says we would have less coronavirus-related deaths if we all just went about our business as usual doesn't have much of a case. I'd highly suggest everyone watch this 15-minute interview with the most interesting voice I've seen on how we strategically get back to some levels of normalcy - how we can be smart and nuanced about it - Dr. David Katz on Bill Maher Friday night. Mark Halperin's COVID-related newsletters have been excellent in presenting different points of view also .  A great many states have seen cases dip and are ready to re-open slowly. That’s fine. I’m glad it’s happening, but I know there can be a mixed bag of some new infections in some states and a mini-explosion for others. Even the Trump administration knows phase one isn’t going to go smoothly for some states, but they’re confident with these guideless that we can minimize a destructive second wave. Also, America needs to start getting back to work, but safely. And that really can’t happen if most of the media, which hates Trump, peddles fake news trash about poison control center calls spiking because of Trump  Editor's Note: Want to support Townhall so we can keep telling the truth about China and the virus they unleashed on the world?

Coronavirus: Contagion risks build in India’s credit market after fund freeze  27 Apr 2020, 07:42 by Bloomberg  By Divya Patil, Bijou George and Anurag Joshi  India’s credit markets were jolted late last week when a major money manager halted withdrawals from mutual funds, adding to a worrying string of superlatives that have been piling up since well before the coronavirus pandemic.  Franklin Templeton’s decision to wind up $4.1 billion of Indian debt funds was the biggest-ever forced closure of funds in the country. It immediately sent corporate borrowing costs soaring, with the spread on one benchmark index rising to a seven-year high. Fresh on its heels, the local venture of France’s AXA SA said it had marked down the value of some of its bond holdings.    Track live updates on coronavirus here    “The problem is unlikely to remain confined to one mutual fund and there are already indications that other mutual funds are facing huge redemption requests,” U.K. Sinha, former chairman of the Securities and Exchange Board of India, wrote in an op-ed in the Indian Express. “The problem of the mutual fund industry can swiftly migrate to the entire financial services industry and might then soon spread to the real economy.”  The Covid-19 crisis has sparked unprecedented moves across global financial markets, and exposed risks that had been building up everywhere in recent years after borrowers binged on debt they’re now unable to repay. But the scope of problems in India’s credit markets is unique.   Also Read:   Coronavirus India update: State-wise total number of confirmed cases     One of The Smallest Credit Markets   Let’s start with this one: the country has long had one of the smallest corporate bond markets among major economies. With that has come some of the worst liquidity -- there just aren’t enough parties trading company debt. That played a major role in the unprecedented move by Franklin Templeton, which cited “a dramatic and sustained fall in liquidity.”  “This episode once again highlights the weakness in the secondary debt markets in India as they tend to get illiquid by small bouts of micro and macro negative news,” said Deepak Jasani, head Of research, HDFC Securities Ltd.   Worst Bad Debt   India also has the world’s worst bad-debt ratio at traditional lenders. That loomed large in March, with the biggest-ever bank failure in the country when authorities seized Yes Bank Ltd.  Efforts to help the finance sector have had unintended consequences. As traditional lenders pared soured loans, shadow banks rushed into the void, borrowing short-term funds that they lent out for longer periods in a classic mismatch. In late 2018, that came to a fore in the collapse of financier IL&FS Group, creating a crisis that the shadow banking industry was still trying to overcome when the pandemic hit.  There have been a round of measures to wean companies from reliance on the non-bank financing companies, but they’ve remained a crucial funding channel for everyone from small vendors to property tycoons.  The shadow banks themselves have often relied on yield-hungry mutual funds like Franklin Templeton to get funds, issuing them debt securities that have become increasingly hard for such investors to unload.  Total assets managed by Indian mutual funds were at a record 28 trillion rupees ($366 billion) as of March 31, with about 29% invested in debt. The frozen Franklin funds account for about 1.4% of the sector’s total assets.   Record Shadow Bank Bond Bill   The mutual fund industry’s thirst for high-yielding shadow bank debt has added to another troubling superlative: non-bank financing firms came into this quarter with a record of about 1.1 trillion rupees of local-currency bond repayments due in the period.  An executive at one of those shadow banks, Bajaj Finance Ltd., recently warned of growing problems even before the Franklin Templeton surprise.  Bajaj Finance Managing Director Rajeev Jain said on a recent earnings call that consumers are in a “state of shock” and are rushing to seek delays in debt repayments, amid the pandemic. Even highly rated companies are looking to postpone repayments, he said.   What’s Next   Like policy makers elsewhere, Indian authorities have moved to keep credit markets from freezing up, and have so far helped avert worse damage.  After a market rout in March, steps to pump more liquidity into the financial system helped lift issuance of shorter-dated local corporate bonds to a record this month, and boosted returns on dollar bonds from the nation’s issuers to the most in Asia in April. Few expect the wild swings to abate, though, particularly after shocks like with Franklin Templeton.  Regulators have encouraged forbearance as businesses grapple with the pandemic and lockdowns. At least 328 borrowers have received or sought a moratorium on loan servicing as part of a Reserve Bank of India Covid-19 relief package, according to rating firm ICRA.  Many observers expect authorities will be forced to take further steps to keep credit markets functioning. And as the latest shock last week showed, the mutual fund industry will be a key focus, not least because of its importance for scores of individual savers.  “The RBI had provided mutual funds with a liquidity window to meet immediate redemption pressures in 2008, in the aftermath of the Lehman collapse,” said Lakshmi Iyer, chief investment officer for debt at Kotak Mahindra Asset Management Co. “In the current crisis due to the spread of Covid-19, any support from the regulators will boost the comfort for the funds and provide more confidence to the domestic financial markets.”   Related stories	News
"Ajaz Khan Gets Bail After Being Arrested For Communal Remarks, Tweets 'Justice Has Prevailed'  27 Apr 2020, 07:48 by Vatsala Devki Vats  On April 19th, ex-Bigg Boss contestant and actor Ajaz Khan had been arrested by Khar polic e for allegedly making hate speech comments that could result in religious disharmony.     TOI  However, it is now being reported that Ajaz Khan has been granted bail and was released yesterday. He was booked under section 153 A for promoting enmity between religious communities with his statements during a Facebook live.  Immediately after, the actor didn't spare time to celebrate his release on Twitter by thanking his fans for their supposed prayers as well as his lawyers.  ""Thank you for all your prayers & good wishes. Justice has prevailed. My gratitude to my lawyers Nazneen Khatri and Zoheb Shaikh. #LoveYouAll,"" Ajaz Khan wrote.     The actor was released by the Bandra Metropolitan Magistrate Court against a surety of Rs 1 Lakh. But a probe and further investigation will continue.     Indiatimes  The real question on everyone's mind is how does getting out on bail equal to justice served? Nobody should be allowed to get away with making any statement that can give rise to feelings of indifference and violence among religious communities. Ajaz Khan has done this several times before, so a strict punishment should be in place to make an example for others to not follow along the same lines."	News
AUD/USD rallies hard to fresh seven-week highs near 0.6470  27 Apr 2020, 07:14 by Dhwani Mehta    Aussie cheers risk-on mood, USD weakness and rally in copper prices.    Upbeat coronavirus data and plans of economic reopening boost risk.    AUD/USD eyes 100-DMA at 0.6573 ahead of FOMC decision.    Amid relentless US dollar selling across the board, AUD/USD clinches a new seven-week high near 0.6470 region, rallying nearly 1.30% in the European session.  The haven demand for the greenback has vanished amid a better market mood, fueled by falling new coronavirus cases and deaths in the global hots and while some major economies plan to reopen business and eases lockdown restrictions. The Bank of Japan’s (BOJ) additional stimulus announcement also helped boost the risk sentiment further.  Further, the commodity-currencies also derives support from the rally in copper prices to six-week highs. The global monetary stimulus hopes combined with China’s effort to ramp up base metals stockpiles prompted the gains in the red metal.  China's Yunnan province is said to announce 1 billion yuan to help businesses stockpile 800,000 tonnes of base metal to boost its real economy after the outbreak. China is the world’s biggest consumer of the non-ferrous metal and it is Australia’s top export destination.  Meanwhile, the aussie ignored the slump in the Chinese industrial profits, as the risk-on market profile dominated. China's Industrial Profits plunged 34.9% YoY in March .  Technically, the spot looks to take out the 0.65 handle on its way to conquer the 100-DMA target at 0.6573.

"Online isolation proms  27 Apr 2020, 07:49 by The Canadian Press     Photo: Tiffany Cadogan    In party dresses or come as you are, with coloured lights flashing in their bedrooms and teachers-turned-DJs spinning, high schoolers have turned to virtual proms to salvage at least one slice of fun and tradition for the Class of 2020.  And they’re getting help from familiar brands like Teen Vogue and Jack in the Box, with both serving as hosts to thousands of teens.  Celebrities, too, are taking on prom: The “Get Out” actress Allison Williams was a guest DJ for Zoom partygoers in Baton Rouge, Louisiana, and “Jack Ryan” star John Krasinski was joined by Billie Eilish when he threw a prom live on YouTube.  “It's terrible that it's happening to your class, but I hope you're having a good time anyway,"" Williams told about 100 teens, staff and guests April 16 at the prom hosted by the Baton Rouge Youth Coalition, an after-school program.  The theme was “Royaltee,” an acknowledgement that while some kids had already bought their dresses before lockdown, others never got the chance and were welcome in T-shirts.  On top, Williams sparkled in a strapless copper sequin dress, joking that she couldn't get up and dance because “there are sweatpants happening.”  Alauna Stults, 17, in Findlay, Ohio, will wear a blue bedazzled two-piece outfit when she attends an online prom May 9 thrown by the party apparel rental service Charlotte's Closet and an event planning site, My School Dance. Charlotte's Closet is donating dresses to teens in need, including Alauna.  ""I was looking forward to prom,” she said. “I was pretty pumped up about it. I was planning on going with a group of my friends, but it's really cool we can still dress up and do everything we would do for a prom, like doing makeup.""  High schools and cheer teams have thrown virtual proms of their own as social media has filled up with sweet moments among families. Dads have taken their dressed-up daughters for living room spins for a dance or two, and teens have organized home proms among parents and siblings.  “Prom is definitely one of those bigger life moments when you're growing up, even if you find it to be corny or not cool. It definitely still is something that's a moment you look back on and remember,” said Teen Vogue Editor-in-Chief Lindsay Peoples Wagner.  The site expects about 5,000 teens to attend its virtual prom May 16 on Zoom. Organizers are working with high schools around the country to set up separate rooms so kids can be with their friends as celebrity co-hosts pop in and DJs get busy.  YouTuber Emma Chamberlain, H.E.R. and “Euphoria” star Storm Reid are expected.  “It will be really interactive, and that's going to be the fun part of it,” Peoples Wagner said.  As part of a social distancing campaign, #StayInTheBox, Jack in the Box is working with schools in San Francisco, Los Angeles, Phoenix and Houston to put on a prom in May, complete with free food and delivery codes.  Serenity Cadogan in Covington, Georgia, near Atlanta is only 12, but she hosted a high school prom live on Instagram on March 31, which was National Prom Day, for more than 600 teens around the world, from Texas to London.  “We wanted to brighten their day,” said the seventh-grader, who leads a chapter of Becca's Closet, a non-profit that donates free prom dresses to high school girls. “Everybody was really happy. It was really classy. I didn't expect that many people but it actually ran pretty smoothly."""	NotNews
Six Lockdown Lawbreakers Test Positive For COVID-19  27 Apr 2020 by Peace FM Online     Six persons out of 32 arrested within the Adentan Municipality for failing to comply with the restrictions on movement order during the partial lockdown have tested positive for COVID-19. The test results were released after the Adentan Circuit Court, where they were standing trial, granted them bail which has since been executed. Those who have tested positive include three men and three women. Three of them have been contacted by the COVID-19 Response Team, while one of them, the police indicated, had travelled to the Oti Region. In reaction to the confirmed cases, the Adentan Divisional Police Station has been disinfected while samples of some officers and inmates on remand at the station have been taken for testing. Screening and tracing Updating the Daily Graphic on the status of the 32 accused persons, the Public Relations Officer of the Accra Regional Police Command, Deputy Superintendent of Police (DSP) Mrs Effia Tenge, said on April 25, 2020, the Adentan COVID-19 Response Team informed the police that six of the accused persons who were put before court and screened on the orders of the court for COVID-19, had tested positive. However, she said the police had on April 20, 2020, executed the bail order by the court and released 27 of the accused persons, including those who had tested positive. They were to reappear before the court on May 9, 10 and 12, 2020. So far, Mrs Effia Tenge said, the three persons had reported to the COVID-19 Response Team and they were currently being managed. She also said that information available to the police indicated that one of the accused persons and a minor who was with the accused at the time of arrest, had travelled to the Oti Region and the Adentan COVID-19 Response Team had subsequently alerted the Oti Region Health Team for contact tracing and isolation. The team, she indicated, had also screened and taken samples from 15 inmates already in the cells who came into contact with the affected persons. Convict rejected One of the accused persons, Mohammed Gariba, who was convicted and sentenced by the court, was rejected by the prison authorities when he was taken to the Nsawam Medium Prisons on April 20, 2020 to commence his four-year sentence. Mrs Tenge said the prison authorities had indicated that the prisons no longer admitted new convicts and that they were to be detained in police custody for further directives. A team from the Police Hospital, therefore, visited the Adentan Police Station for assessment and after interacting with the Adentan COVID-19 Response Team, they took custody of Gariba and a remand prisoner who was also in the custody of the police for isolation. Police personnel tested Also, 20 personnel of the Adentan Divisional Police have been tested to ascertain their status. They are awaiting the results of the test and the situation has caused some anxiety among the personnel. A source close to the divisional command told the Daily Graphic when it visited the station last Saturday that the officers were also at post and had not been asked to stay home. The source said in dealing with the suspects, the police had worn their nose masks but did not use gloves or other personnel protective equipment (PPE) as required. “Immediately the results of the test on the samples were confirmed as positive, some of the officers became worried, but in collaboration with the COVID-19 Response Team, samples of 20 officers who had come into contact with the suspects were taken and we are awaiting results. “Though we had our masks on, the suspects arrested and brought to the station did not have masks on, thus there was a risk of officers being exposed to the virus, causing some apprehension. “ Of course, they are human beings, so naturally they will be worried about the situation, particularly, as they wait for the results. However, they are being counselled and we are awaiting the outcome of the test to know the next line of action,” the source said. Personnel safety The source also reminded all police personnel to be mindful of the detailed briefing on the COVID-19 operations and safety measures which have become part of the daily briefing of operational activities to ensure their safety in the discharge of their duties. “Ahead of Ghana recording its first case of COVID-19, the Ghana Police Service held workshops for personnel and it included all the safety precautions and divisional and district commands are required to get their personnel to go by the details of the briefings. “Additionally, some basic PPE have been provided for all stations and personnel to ensure the adherence to the safety precautions. “Personnel are thus encouraged to ensure their safety at all levels by having their nose masks and hand gloves on in all operations; they should not take it for granted,” the source advised.

Redemption pressure in credit risk mutual funds persists  AUM of credit risk fund category has been falling and the category has seen continuous outflows.  27 Apr 2020 by Himadri Buch  The special liquidity facility of Rs 50,000 crore created by the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) may have boosted confidence of mutual funds but they continue to face redemption pressure.  According to large mutual fund houses, private banks who are wealth managers to high networth individuals (HNIs) rushed to redeem their credit risk fund investments on April 27.  A Balasubramanian, CEO, Aditya Birla Sun Life Mutual Fund, confirmed that credit risk funds are witnessing redemptions. “Redemptions are only in credit risk funds, but we expect it to ease going forward,” Balasubramanian told Moneycontrol.  Concurring Balasubramanian’s view, a sales head from one of the top mutual fund houses, said, “After April 23 and 24 and particularly after the Franklin Templeton episode, the ones who had decided over the weekend to safeguard their investments have redeemed on April 27, so redemptions have continued today as well.”  Mutual funds are awaiting the total redemption number for April 27. Most fund houses expect the redemption number to be ‘reasonably higher’.  Another fund manager from a mid-sized fund house said credit risk fund investments largely come via advisors or wealth managers, so if wealth managers are advising redemption, investors are going ahead with it.  In a bid to boost sentiment, the Reserve Bank of India (RBI), on April 27, announced a special liquidity facility for mutual funds worth Rs 50,000 crore as redemptions rose after Franklin Templeton closed six debt mutual funds last week.  The RBI's liquidity infusion has provided a sigh of relief for most mutual funds, particularly the ones struggling with redemptions.  It will also instil confidence among customers, they hope, and thereby reduce liquidity pressures.  Most mutual funds are of the view that RBI’s move will instil confidence in fund houses, particularly the ones struggling with redemptions.  Credit risk funds suffer The credit risk funds category has been suffering since the IL&FS troubles surfaced in September 2018.  Credit risk funds and few other debt categories have been facing the heat for the past year-and-a-half because quite a few companies have faced difficulty in paying regular interest to their lenders (mutual funds, banks, insurance companies and so on) and, in some cases, returning the principal too. Frequent downgrades in credit ratings took the net asset values of debt funds down.  AUM of credit risk fund category has been falling and the category has seen continuous outflows. In FY20, the AUM of the credit risk funds' category fell 30.46 percent to Rs 55,380 crore.  Franklin Templeton MF fiasco On April 23, Franklin Templeton announced that it has shut down six of its credit strategy oriented debt mutual fund schemes. These schemes are: - Franklin India Ultra Short Bond Fund, - Franklin India Short Term Income Fund, - Franklin India Credit Risk Fund, - Franklin India Low Duration Fund, - Franklin India Dynamic Accrual Fund and - Franklin India Income Opportunities Fund.  Calling it an 'extremely' difficult decision, Sanjay Sapre, President, Franklin Templeton Mutual Fund-India said reduced liquidity in the bond market in March and April forced the fund house to take this drastic step.  March and April saw a significant reduction in liquidity in the bond market. The company witnessed unprecedented illiquidity for securities rated below AAA, Sapre said.  He added that schemes could not generate cash-to-fund redemptions after the lockdown was extended as it drastically reduced the market's risk appetite.

Bitcoin Halving: A New Class Of Bitcoin Millionaires May Emerge  27 Apr 2020 by Luke Fitzpatrick    The photo shows a physical imitation of a Bitcoin in Dortmund, western Germany, on January 27, 2020. ... [+] (Photo by INA FASSBENDER / AFP) (Photo by INA FASSBENDER/AFP via Getty Images) AFP via Getty Images   Crypto investors and hodlers alike are sitting on the edge of their seats, waiting to see what unfolds with the highly anticipated bitcoin halving event that is scheduled to take place mid-May.  Since bitcoin’s inception in 2009, the halving (also known as halvening), is an event that takes place roughly every 4 years. During the halving, block rewards are cut in half, which in turn, limits the supply of bitcoins.  Michael Dubrovsky, cofounder of the mining company PoWx puts sheds light as to how the bitcoin halving impacts price, “The theory is that there will be less bitcoin available to buy if miners have less to sell.” So, from a supply-demand perspective:   If bitcoin supply decreases and the demand for bitcoin stays the same, then the price of bitcoin will increase.  If bitcoin supply decreases and the demand for bitcoin increases (ie. Institutional investors, millennials, or boomers, etc. looking to capitalize on the hype increases), then the price of bitcoin will see a significant increase in price.    Bitcoin halving historical performance   To date, there have only been 2 bitcoin halvings . From a historical perspective, during previous bitcoin halvings, each time the price of bitcoin has reached all-time new highs:   On November 28th, 2012, the first bitcoin halving occurred, which saw the price of bitcoin increase from $11 to $1,000 around a year later.  During July 2016, the second halving took place and the price of bitcoin was trading at around $700, and in 2017, the price skyrocketed to $20,000.     Bitcoin halving Coindesk   The third bitcoin halving, which is scheduled to take place in May 2020 has seen some lofty predictions on bitcoin prices. Billionaire bitcoin bull Tim Draper believes that the price of one bitcoin could rise to $250,000 ; Buffett’s Books founder Preston Pysh thinks that bitcoin could skyrocket to $300,000 after the halving; former Goldman Sachs GS hedge fund manager Raoul Pal predicts that the price of bitcoin to hit $1,000,000 within 3 years; and Silk Road founder Ross Ulbricht predicted that it could hit an astronomical price of $333,000,000 per bitcoin.   More bitcoin millionaires may materialize   During the previous 2 bitcoin halvings, countless millionaires were created. J.R. Forsyth, the founder of Onfo was one of them. He was studying mathematics as an undergraduate and was exposed to bitcoin and digital ledger technology.  Forsyth says, “It became obvious to me that math-based currencies (like bitcoin) would eventually supplant sovereign notes. I mined bitcoin and litecoin very early on and held onto them. The massive appreciation of those assets allowed me to invest in other cryptocurrency technology which ultimately led to the development of Onfo, a platform that helps people earn money through network mining.”  Or take Alan Glanse, charity founder and CEO of the cannabis business JuicyFields for instance. During his Wall Street days, he bought 100 bitcoins from a colleague that urgently needed money in 2012. Then, he forgot about his bitcoin. It wasn’t until the parabolic price highs of 2017’s second bitcoin halving, that he realized that he had become an instant millionaire.  Glanse believes that the stimulus package will only strengthen the US economy and substantial market growth can be witnessed 2-3 months after the bitcoin halving event.   The Federal Reserve   The Fed’s balance sheet is expected to exceed $6.5 trillion this year, with never seen before levels of money printing. In retrospect, that represents an increase of more than $2 trillion in under 6 weeks.  Todd Crossland, CEO of CoinZoom says that “While I applaud and support the government in taking the most aggressive measures in providing stimulus for the economy, just the magnitude of the stimulus and printing of dollars, and the accompanying debt gives me a reason to pause. The stimulus will come with inflation and subsequently pressure on the value of the dollar. In my opinion, this paints another bull case for bitcoin and digital assets.”  Right now, the world is undergoing a major financial shift. During the black swan stock market crash of March 2020, investors dropped stocks for cash, resulting in a liquidity crunch . The price of bitcoin and other digital crypto assets took a temporary nosedive. Since then, bitcoin has fully recovered, along with most other crypto assets. That said, if the Fed’s stimulus plan results in deflation, then followed shortly after by hyperinflation, this could paint a very bullish scenario for bitcoin.   A massive shift in wealth   Billionaire investor and founder of Bridgewater Associates, Ray Dalio , believes that in the near future, there could be a massive shift of wealth. Many in the crypto community have taken this to imply that cryptocurrencies like bitcoin are the solution to which Dalio speaks of. If that’s the case, then a new class of millionaires may emerge from the severe crisis that is gripping the world’s economy.  Dalio says , “Governments that have the power to do so are printing money to help ease the debt burdens and help finance the expenses that are denominated in their own currencies, which will weaken their own currencies and raise their levels of monetary inflation to offset the deflation that is coming from reduced demand and forced asset sales that are happening as those that are stretched have to raise cash.”  Dalio is a firm believer that wealth cannot simply be created by producing more money and credit and that the long-term debt cycle is coming to its end. Dalio suspects that a restructuring of the monetary system is imminent. With countries like Venezuela , Lebanon , and the Bahamas exchanging local currencies for bitcoin, then Dalio may indeed be correct. If that is the case, then the third bitcoin halving could be a major catalyst for monetary change , resulting in a generation of new crypto millionaires .	NotNews

"‘SOMETHING TERRIBLE’S HAPPENED’  Roommates use Find My Friends App to uncover young woman’s murder  27 Apr 2020, 09:43 by Samantha Lock   COLLEGE roommates have told how they used the Find My Friends App to uncover the body of their murdered friend by tracing her location to her killer's bedroom.   Friends of Haley Anderson, 22, described climbing in through a window to find the grisly scene after becoming concerned when the New York nursing student didn't show for an event.    Nursing student Haley Anderson was found via the Find My Friends App Credit: Facebook     Haley had been killed by her former on-off boyfriend Orlando Tercero Credit: CBS   Haley was strangled by her classmate and former on-and-off-again boyfriend Orlando Tercero who later fled to Nicaragua.  The Binghamton University nursing student first went missing the morning of March 8, 2018.  Her friend Josie Artin told CBS News' 48 Hours: ""I texted her that morning. She didn't answer. I figured she was still asleep.  ""When I first didn't hear from her, I didn't think, 'Oh, something terrible has happened'.  ""She had told me she was going to come watch me read poetry at poetry night that Thursday and then she didn't show up.  ""We were all calling her and she didn't answer. It was the next morning and we were like 'this doesn't make sense'.""  VANISHED  Haley's friends became concerned when she disappeared from social media and didn't show for an event.  They eventually discovered her phone was in Tercero's apartment.

The Find My Friends App allows people to locate friends or loved ones on Apple devices.  Users can share their location with friends by choosing people from a contact list, phone numbers, email addresses or AirDrop.

PM: Coronavirus like unexpected and invisible mugger   27 Apr 2020, 09:47    Boris Johnson reflected on his own close-run experience with Covid-19 following his return to work.     Prime Minister Boris Johnson makes a statement outside 10 Downing Street   The Prime Minister has labelled coronavirus an “invisible mugger” after his own personal experience facing off the deadly illness.  Boris Johnson returned to work on Monday after convalescing for two weeks at Chequers, the PM’s country residence, following his discharge from hospital.  The 55-year-old spent three nights in intensive care following his admittance on April 5 to St Thomas’ Hospital in central London, and later revealed his struggle with Covid-19 “could have gone either way” during that period.  Speaking outside Downing Street to mark his return, Mr Johnson said he was “sorry I have been away from my desk for much longer than I would have liked”.  He said the UK was on its way to tackling coronavirus after social distancing measures had ensured the NHS had not been overwhelmed during the peak of the infections.  Mr Johnson said: “If this virus were a physical assailant, an unexpected and invisible mugger – which I can tell you from personal experience it is – then this is the moment when we have begun together to wrestle it to the floor.”  While at Chequers last week, the Conservative Party leader was in regular talks with those leading the UK coronavirus response, including Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab, who was deputising for the PM, but this week will see him leading the Government in public once again.  Health Secretary Matt Hancock, another leading figure in the battle against Covid-19, responded to Mr Johnson’s public appearance, tweeting: “Great to see the boss back and on top form.”  Nadine Dorries, the first minister to be diagnosed with the virus, said the PM was back to work quicker than many others would be in his situation.    Prime Minister Boris Johnson makes a statement outside 10 Downing Street (Stefan Rousseau/PA)   “Most who have been as poorly as Boris Johnson with Covid-19 and a patient for a week in intensive care would be off work for at least three months to fully recover their strength and repair their immune system,” the health minister tweeted.  “Our PM is back after just three weeks. Good luck boss.”  Edward Argar, a fellow health minister, said he was “hugely pleased” to see Mr Johnson “back at work today with his health fully restored”.  He told BBC Radio 4’s Today programme the PM would be “looking very carefully” at how to lift the lockdown measures now that he was back at the helm.  During his speech outside Number 10, Mr Johnson promised “transparency” over future decisions on social distancing and vowed to involve businesses and opposition parties when deciding a way forward.

Karanja Ndegwa Appointed Jambojet’s Managing Director In An Acting Capacity  27 Apr 2020, 09:34 by Eva Nyambura  Low-cost carrier Jambojet has appointed Karanja Ndegwa as its new managing director in an acting capacity.  Mr Ndegwa will take over the reins of power effective May 1.  Ndegwa, the airline’s chief financial officer replaces Allan Kilavuka who is now Kenya Airways CEO.  “We are grateful that Ndegwa has accepted to continue serving as the Chief Financial Officer even as he takes on the new role of acting Managing Director,” Chairman, Board of Directors Vincent Rague said on Monday.  Ndegwa, an Economics and Statistics graduate from the University of Nairobi has over 20 years of experience in the aviation industry.  12 of these years have been in positions of leadership.  Before joining Jambojet, he served as Manager – Revenue Accounting at KQ.  Ndegwa takes over at a time when the spread of COVID-19 has seen a significant reduction in airline passengers.  As of April 6, KQ and Jambojet had grounded planes and cut on frequencies as coronavirus effects bite.  In March the airline decided to suspend its services to Kigali, Rwanda and Entebbe, Uganda.  But resolved to still operate flights to Malindi, Ukunda, Mombasa, Kisumu and Eldoret.  The aviation and tourism industry are the hardest hit by the effects of the pandemic.  KQ for instance has turned four passenger planes into cargo planes as a way of keeping the already struggling company afloat post coronavirus.  Related	News
GU-Q graduate turns school project at QF into National Teleschool Curriculum in Pakistan   27 Apr 2020, 09:01   Doha: A digital education programme that began as a student project at Georgetown University in Qatar (GU-Q), a QF partner university, is now part of a nationally broadcast TV channel in Pakistan launched by Prime Minister Imran Khan this month to support students impacted by pandemic school closures. Available nationwide, the new channel, called Teleschool, will be broadcast daily to provide online education for grades one through twelve.  For Teleschool’s primary education level programming, the Pakistan government turned to Orenda, an educational organisation co-founded by 2015 GU-Q graduate Haroon Yasin while he was a senior.  Through Orenda, the GU-Q students developed a cartoon-based digital app called Taleemabad, Urdu for “Education City,’’ that offers a fun learning opportunity for children in Pakistan who are underperforming or unable to attend school.  With the move to television, says Haroon, Taleemabad will now also be a full-fledged animated series. “The new TV format will still see the original five characters that so many children have come to love in our app, taking students on a learning journey to teach lessons in phonics, math, and science.” The telelearning initiative is slated for a 3 month run, with the potential to extend the programming beyond that.  While the power of the internet has unleashed countless educational resources, said Haroon, Taleemabad is uniquely tailored to the region’s needs. “The series is mapped out to the Pakistan education curriculum. But more than that, young learners can see themselves in the identities of the characters who look, dress, and speak like them too.”  Before joining the new teleschool channel, the Taleemabad app recently saw a massive jump in downloads, adding 20,000 new users in March alone, with almost 200,000 users accessing the fun cartoon-based format that incorporates assessments developed by a team of education professionals. “Assessing our students so rigorously allows us to identify learning deficits, keep them on track, and help them to become better learners.”  And financing has been secured to expand users to one million students by the end of 2020.  With one of the highest youth populations and a struggling education sector, says Haroon, the stakes couldn’t be higher. “Before the pandemic, under enrollment and underperformance was already a problem. The pandemic has introduced a new danger: the likelihood that students would be progressed to the next grade without establishing foundational concepts. But with this national TV project, we have the ability to close those gaps, and to convince kids that learning can be fun, too.”  Working with specialists, Haroon is also building in age-appropriate lessons around the pandemic, including a new character: the coronavirus. “There is so much emphasis on the morbidity of the virus. But children have very different kinds of questions. They want to know why they can’t go out, why they can’t see their friends.”  Not letting success slow his ambitions, Haroon, whose education work has landed him on Forbes 30 Under 30 - Social Entrepreneurs in Asia in 2020 and garnered a Queen’s Young Leaders award from Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth II in 2018, says Taleemabad is just getting started. He hopes to add more grade levels soon, completing K-Grade 6, and reach even more at-risk young learners by launching a radio version of the program, and expanding efforts into neighboring countries in the region as well.

The team from the Singapore University of Technology and Design used an artificial intelligence algorithm to make data-driven predictions of when the Covid-19 pandemic will end in 131 countries.  The predictions were uploaded on the university’s website on 26 April.  According to the predictions, the pandemic is likely to end in the world by 9 December, though some countries, including Bahrain and Qatar, will see the last of its fresh cases in February 2021.  For India, the team predicts that 97 per cent of the total expected cases will be identified by 21 May .    Also read:  How Bihar Covid situation deteriorated in 3 weeks, and why doctors fear worst is yet to come    The model  According to the researchers, Covid-19 follows a lifecycle pattern similar to other pandemics. The outbreak has an initial acceleration phase, which witnesses an exponential rise in cases. This is followed by the inflection point — or the point at which the curve begins to flatten.  This point is followed by a deceleration phase, where the curve begins to dip, eventually bringing the pandemic to an end.  Researchers explained that the curve responds to counter-strategies of individuals and governments, which include social distancing and lockdowns, along with natural limitations of the ecosystem.  To predict when the pandemic will end for every country, researchers plotted the latest infection data from each country initially and then used the SIR model to predict the curve for each country.  An SIR model computes the number of people that will likely become infected with a contagious illness in a population over a period of time.  The computation is based on the number of people susceptible to the disease (S), the number of people infected (I) and the number of people who have recovered (R) from the disease.  The predictions provide three alternative estimates of end dates — the date when the last expected case has been identified, the date when 99 per cent of the expected total cases have been identified, and the date when 97 per cent of the expected cases have been identified.  The predictions based on data until 25 April showed that the pandemic is likely to end in the worst-affected countries like the US and Italy by the last week of August, though both countries will identify 97 per cent of the total cases by 12 May and 8 May, respectively.  Limitations  The researchers, however, advised caution in interpreting the results of the predictions. They said becoming overly optimistic based on some predicted end dates “might be dangerous”.  Easing existing restrictions can cause the infection rates to change, the researchers pointed out.  The model also does not take into account the possibility of a second wave of infections.  The quality of the predictions also depends on the quality of the data, the researchers said. This means the estimates may not be accurate for countries that may be under-reporting cases.

Italy to Reopen Factories in Staged End to Coronavirus Lockdown  Museums and libraries can reopen from May 18, when sports teams will also be able to resume group training.  27 Apr 2020, 08:02 by Reuters      Italy will allow factories and building sites to reopen from May 4 and permit limited family visits as it prepares a staged end to Europe’s longest coronavirus lockdown, Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte said on Sunday.   More than two months after the first case of COVID-19 appeared in a small town outside Milan and following weeks of lockdown, Italy is looking ahead to a second phase of the crisis in which it will attempt to restart the economy without triggering a new wave of infections.  “We expect a very complex challenge,” Conte said as he outlined the road map to restarting activities put into hibernation since early March. “We will live with the virus and we will have to adopt every precaution possible.”  Manufacturers, construction companies and some wholesalers will be allowed to reopen from May 4, followed by retailers two weeks later. Restaurants and bars will be allowed to reopen fully from the beginning of June, although takeaway business will be possible earlier.  “The reopening is allowed on condition that all companies involved strictly respect security protocols in the workplace,” Conte said, adding that the reopening would lay the ground for deeper reforms of the economy in the months ahead.  In addition, parks will be allowed to reopen and limited family visits and funerals with no more than 15 people present will be permitted. But movement between regions remains suspended and people moving about will still have to carry a declaration explaining the reasons for their journeys.  Museums and libraries can reopen from May 18, when sports teams will also be able to resume group training, although Conte said conditions would have to be assessed before any decision on resuming the top-flight Serie A soccer championship.  Schools will remain shut, however, until the start of the new academic year in September, leaving families facing childcare problems for months to come.  ECONOMIC HIT  The lockdown has put a strain on the euro zone’s third-largest economy, which is headed for its worst recession since World War Two. Italian business leaders have called for the restrictions to be eased to head off economic catastrophe.  Conte said the more limited restrictions would likely remain in place until the discovery of an effective vaccine or cure for COVID-19, which is not expected for many months.  On Sunday, Italian authorities reported a third consecutive daily fall in coronavirus fatalities, with 260 deaths, the lowest number since March 14.  Italy’s death toll remains the heaviest in Europe, with more than 26,000 dead and almost 200,000 confirmed cases of the respiratory disease. But the number of new cases has been slowing and the number of patients in intensive care has been falling steadily.  Hit hard by the virus weeks before other major Western countries, Italy has been forced to serve as a model for how to fight it. It is being closely watched around the world as it takes its early steps to chart a path out of a strict lockdown it imposed in early March.  Some businesses deemed “strategic”, including activity that was mainly export-oriented, could reopen this week providing they get the go-ahead from local prefects.  Exporting companies need to resume activity sooner to reduce the risk of being cut out of the production chain and losing business, Conte said in an interview with the daily Repubblica earlier on Sunday.  Rome has introduced a series of measures including state-backed loans to help businesses stay afloat. But some business officials have complained about delays in implementing them.  Conte said the government was monitoring banks to make sure state-guaranteed liquidity arrived to companies in need.  He also said the government was working on a series of measures to help industry by cutting bureaucratic red tape.   Related News	News
New York to reopen economy in phases - Governor  27 Apr 2020, 08:51 by Agency Report  The U.S. state of New York will restart its economy after the peak of the coronavirus outbreak in a multi-phase manner, Governor Andrew Cuomo said on Sunday.  The strategy is to first reopen the construction and manufacturing sectors, and the second phase will be evaluating businesses on a case-by-case basis, depending on how essential they are, said Cuomo at his daily briefing.  There will be two weeks in between each phase to monitor the effects of the reopening and ensure hospitalisation and infection rates are not increasing.  “One caveat is you can’t do anything in any region that would increase the number of visitors to that region,” the governor said.  Cuomo did not give a specific date for the implementation of the strategy, but he said part of the state could begin reopening as soon as May 15 — the current deadline for the statewide shutdown.  The regions that would be more likely able to open sooner would be the upstate New York, where COVID-19 infections have been relatively low in the state, said Cuomo.  The reopening of the downstate region, which includes the hardest-hit New York City, Nassau County and Westchester, will be more complicated and requires regional coordination, he noted.  “Multi-state coordination is vital there because the New Jersey, Connecticut, New York City area is basically very intermixed,” said Cuomo.  “People are going and coming, they live in one place, work in another, so that coordination is important,” he added.  New York state continued to see a declining trend of total hospitalisations and net intubations, and the daily fatalities dropped to 367 on Saturday, according to the governor.  He also said the infection rate decreased to 0.8 in the state, referring to the situation where “10 positive people infect about eight others.”  “We must keep the rate below 1 to keep slowing the spread,” said Cuomo.  The state reported over 299,000 COVID-19 cases as the national total rose to nearly 962,000 by Sunday afternoon.  More than 22,000 people statewide have died of the disease, according to data compiled by Johns Hopkins University. (Xinhua/ NAN )	News
"Individualistic mindset of West comes through in protests against COVID measures  27 Apr 2020, 08:00 by Melissa Couto    Armed protesters join hundreds of people outside the City County Building as they rally for the opening of non-life sustaining businesses in Pennsylvania on Monday, April 20, 2020, in downtown Pittsburgh. The individualistic mindset of the West is being seen in COVID protests. THE CANADIAN PRESS/AP/Andrew Rush/Pittsburgh Post-Gazette via AP   The photos were circulating on social media all week.  A man in Pittsburgh dressed in a George Washington mask holding what appeared to be a semi-automatic weapon. A woman in Denver leering out her car window as a front-line health care worker tried to block her path.  Protests against stay-at-home orders that can halt the spread of the COVID-19 pandemic are popping up nearly daily in the United States, with some spilling into Canada, too.  A demonstration in Toronto on Saturday led Ontario Premier Doug Ford to call the participants ""a bunch of yahoos."" A similar protest against coronavirus restrictions happened in Vancouver days earlier.  While the majority of Americans and Canadians seem to be adhering to lockdown measures, experts in sociology, political science and history aren't surprised to see a recent rise in protests.  Alison Meek, an associate professor of American history at Western University in London, Ont., says the U.S. in particular — a country ""born out of rebellion"" — has historically taken issue with allowing the federal government too much power.  ""I see in this very much that individualistic spirit of Americans and that goes right back to the founding of the country,"" Meek said. ""They're not going to listen to the federal government. They don't believe in that authority.""  While the U.S. has been no stranger to public protests in the past, Meek said there's more to these pandemic-related demonstrations, including economic factors and ""a real anti-science, anti-expert component.""  ""Every expert is saying you need to do the social distancing, you've got to flatten the curve. And there is a real sense from a lot of Americans of: 'you can't tell us what to do,'"" she said. ""They're going to just listen to their own instincts. They're going to listen to what they see on Facebook or Twitter or whatever social media they're following.  ""So I think it's just this confluence of stuff that's coming into play. ... and the misinformation that's out there is making this so much worse than it should be.""  Multiple protests broke out across the U.S. last week, including in Vermont, Virginia, Wisconsin and California, with most of them organized via social media.  A private Facebook group was key in enlisting people for a ""Liberate Minnesota"" march outside the governor's home last Friday, and U.S. President Donald Trump backed the protesters on Twitter, calling to ""LIBERATE MINNESOTA"" right before it happened.  ""Trump is that ultimate populist,"" Meek said. ""When his own experts are saying X, and he comes in and says, 'no, no, no we're going to do Y,' that shows even he doesn't trust his own experts.  ""He is this quintessential I'm going to trust my feelings type of guy. ... And that trickles down to his supporters, like: 'why should we trust the PhDs in virology and microbiology?'""  The protests around the U.S. and Canada have been relatively small — roughly 100 people participated in the Toronto demonstration over the weekend and a police spokeswoman said the crowd adhered to physical distancing rules after it was requested.  Still, Max Cameron, a political science professor at the University of British Columbia in Vancouver, said he's been ""appalled"" by some of the images he's seen of the protests, specifically in the U.S.  ""But I don't think I can tell you I'm surprised,"" he added. ""When the President is sending out tweets, encouraging people to liberate their states and tapping into that states-rights rhetoric, that gives political cover to what they're doing.""  Cameron sees a disjointed message between policy makers and politicians in the U.S., where different cities or counties within states may have their own rules for physical distancing and business closures.  And that could be sparking some of these protests.  ""What we know from studies in public opinion is the public is more likely to be divided if elected officials are divided,"" Cameron said. ""But if the political class is relatively unified, society will tend to unify behind what the messages are from our elected officials.""  Zohreh BayatRizi, an associate professor of sociology at the University of Alberta in Edmonton, believes the downturn of the economy is likely playing another major role in the protests.  She said the rollout for government assistance hasn't gone that smoothly in some parts of the U.S., leading to a conflict between what people are being told to do and their ability to stay economically viable.  But BayatRizi, who's an expert in the sociology of mortality, sees another layer to the demonstrations.  ""It can be hard for people, especially younger people, to think that something fatal won't impact them, so there's a sense of being immune or invulnerable,"" BayatRizi said, adding that early descriptions of the virus as one that affected mostly older people didn't help sway that point of view.  ""When you're talking about all those people (protesting) out there, the pictures I am seeing are of younger people or middle aged people, not ones who are much older.""  Cameron said that while images of protests have been hard to see for people adhering to physical distancing themselves, it's important to remember that these demonstrations are depicting a minority.  He said the bigger picture is the ""unprecedented collective action"" being done to limit the pandemic's spread.  ""You'd have to go back to war time to find a time when so many people have been asked to sacrifice so much for the greater good,"" he said. ""We're not being asked to go off to war fortunately, we're just being asked to stay home.  ""And the idea that millions and millions of people are doing the same thing in an effort to achieve the common good is a testament to the capacity of good democracies to really get things done.""  This report by The Canadian Press was first published April 27, 2020."	News
Josh Addo-Carr and Latrell Mitchell flout Australia’s social distancing measures  The pair were fined 1,000 Australian dollars by New South Wales Police.   27 Apr 2020, 08:19   Melbourne winger Josh Addo-Carr and South Sydney full-back Latrell Mitchell have been criticised by the NRL for flouting Australia’s social distancing measures.  The pair, both of whom have been capped by Australia, and Newcastle Knights squad player Tyronne Roberts-Davis were fined 1,000 Australian dollars by New South Wales Police after a gathering with several others over the weekend.  Police were alerted after Addo-Carr posted images, since deleted, on his Instagram account as the trio ignored Government orders of staying 1.5 metres apart and gathering in large groups because of coronavirus.     The NRL said in a statement on its website: “Our players are role models and we expect them to lead by example during this pandemic.  “On face value, the image in today’s media is both disappointing and an unacceptable breach of health orders.  “The NRL will be speaking to the players involved to seek further information and we will ensure the players provide any assistance authorities require.  “We are embarking on a significant education program to ensure our players understand what is acceptable behaviour ahead of the resumption of training.     “As a group, our players have taken Government health orders very seriously and have helped educate the community. On face value, today’s matter is unacceptable and we support the Government in any action they believe necessary.”  The NRL indefinitely suspended the 2020 campaign last month because of the pandemic.

"Manoj Bajpayee Reveals How He Celebrated His Birthday While Being Stranded In Uttarakhand  27 Apr 2020, 06:55 by Swikriti Srivastava  Unlike most of the celebrities, Manoj Bajpayee couldn't be at home when the nationwide lockdown was imposed in India. The actor was in Uttarakhand, shooting for his next film. In a recent tete-a-tete with a leading daily, the actor spoke about being stranded in Uttarakhand and how he has no qualms about his current situation as his family is with him.  On April 23, the actor turned a year older and celebrated his birthday in the most unique way. He said, ""The property we are staying at, the people here made sure that it goes off well in whatever way they could manage. They decorated with some of the balloons lying here. My nine-year-old daughter and wife made cards for me, those were the personal touches I loved. My director (of the film I was shooting for) wrote a beautiful poem, which completely touched me.""     He further added, ""I spend all day with my family and the unit people, with a lot of laughter. Then we had the cake and food we all cooked together. That's how this birthday went, unique and fantastic. It's going to be quite memorable.""  In the same interview, Bajpayee also condemned the brutal attacks on the healthcare workers of our nation.  He said, ""I don't know who are these guys attacking doctors and nurses, who are our true heroes. The health sector are the frontline warriors, who are trying to make each and every person feel safe and healthy. The attackers should be ashamed of themselves, they can't just go ahead and attack, let alone even think of it. I strongly condemn this act of violence against frontline workers. I cannot understand it, and the law should take it's own course.""  We totally agree with the Satya actor and hope that people stop tormenting the nation's healthcare workers and observe the lockdown diligently."	NotNews

Ford rules out fourth-gen Focus RS  27 Apr 2020, 06:00 by Staff Writer  Stricter emission regulations and high development costs for hybrid powertrain rule out Focus RS derivative.  Ford has no plans to introduce a range-topping RS performance version of the current-gen Focus.  As per a report by our sister publication Autocar UK in February, the possibility of a fourth-generation Focus RS hinged on the development of a high-output hybrid powertrain that would minimise the performance model’s impact on Ford’s fleet average CO2 emissions.  It has now been confirmed, however, that the development of such a system for the model has been deemed not cost-effective, and so Ford isn't planning a new Focus RS.  A Ford spokesperson said: “As a result of pan-European emissions standards, increased CO2 taxation and the high cost of developing an RS with some form of electrification for a relatively low volume of vehicles, we are not planning another RS version of the Focus.  “We remain committed to Ford Performance vehicles in Europe as part of our DNA, with cars like the multi-award-winning Focus ST and Fiesta ST, as well as our Mustang and Ranger Raptor models.”  We weren’t expecting to see a new Focus RS until 2022 at the earliest. Earlier this year, a senior source at Ford told Autocar UK, “We are waiting for our engineering team to come up with a solution on the powertrain, and that is not easy given the new fleet CO2 regulations.”  With no Focus RS in the range, the Focus ST, which currently heads up the model range with 280hp in its most potent guise, will remain the hottest variant for the foreseeable future.  The news comes as it’s revealed that the Mustang will likely adopt an electrified powertrain in 2022 as part of the manufacturer’s ambition to launch 18 mild-hybrid and full-hybrid models by 2022.  A hybrid Mustang had been set to arrive this year, but the development of the Mustang Mach-E electric SUV was fast-tracked as a priority.  Coming to the Indian market, Ford has no plans to bring the Focus hatchback to India, with the carmaker having spent the early part of 2020 upgrading its existing line-up to meet the new BS6 emission norms. The carmaker, however, is expected to launch the Mustang facelift in India later this year, followed by the all-electric Mustang Mach-E by 2021 .	NotNews

San Francisco’s shelter-in-place order is ‘very likely’ to be extended past May 3, Mayor London Breed said  27 Apr 2020, 15:50 by Katie Canales, Business Insider US    San Francisco in April 2020. Justin Sullivan/Getty Images    The shelter-in-place order in San Francisco will likely be extended past its current expiration date of May 3.  The regionwide order, which was the first in the US, has already been extended once from its original deadline of April 7.  The news comes as residents have already been isolating inside their homes for weeks now to help slow the spread of the coronavirus disease.  But until factors including widespread testing and contact tracing are considered, reopening is unlikely.  Visit Business Insider’s homepage for more stories .   The shelter-in-place order for San Francisco is “very likely” to be extended past its current May 3 deadline, Mayor London Breed said in a Friday news conference.  “What that means is another few weeks or even a month of asking you all to comply and to remain at home and to continue to follow the social distancing orders that we put forth,” she said at the news conference, according to the San Francisco Chronicle.  The news comes as the city, as well as the rest of the US, continues to fight the spread of the coronavirus disease, known as COVID-19. The regionwide order was the first in the country to be enforced on March 17 in response to the coronavirus disease.  The order has already been extended once to May 3, past its original expiration date of April 7. Residents are directed to remain inside their homes as much as possible and can leave for essential items, like to go grocery shopping or to go for a walk. The city now requires people to wear masks while in public, specifically when in the vicinity of essential businesses such as grocery stores or restaurants.  Another Bay Area county, Solano County, north of San Francisco, has extended its shelter-in-place order through May 17. For the most part, Bay Area counties have been following the same recommendations from public health officials on how to modify the shelter-in-place orders in their respective locales.  There are 1,424 confirmed cases in San Francisco, with many coming from nursing homes and homeless shelters, including MSC South, San Francisco’s largest shelter. The shelter experienced an outbreak in early April, when 100 people tested positive for the disease.  A reopening plan detailed by California Gov. Gavin Newsom said multiple factors – including widespread testing and contact tracing – would need to be considered before restrictions could eventually be relaxed. Newsom issued a statewide stay-at-home order on March 19.  San Francisco public health director Dr. Grant Colfax on Friday said that the “curve is flat” in the city, but that doesn’t mean life can return to normal just yet.  That reality is especially stark for those that have been grappling with the economic fallout of the pandemic. The mayor said on Friday that her office expects the city’s unemployment tally to reach 100,000 in the near future, or one in every nine residents, as reported by Curbed SF .	News

High Court confirms appointment of examiner to CityJet   27 Apr 2020, 15:23   The High Court has confirmed the appointment of an examiner to the regional airline CityJet.  Mr Justice Michael Quinn said on Monday he was satisfied to appoint insolvency practitioner Kieran Wallace of KPMG as examiner to CityJet DAC.  The decision gives Mr Wallace, who earlier this month was appointed on an interim basis, up to 100 days to formulate a scheme of arrangement with the airline’s creditors which must then be approved by the court.  The airline and its subsidiaries, which flies routes on behalf of other airlines including SAS and Aer Lingus , and employs 1,175 people, 417 of whom are based in Dublin, believes it can continue.  There were no objections to the airline being granted the protection of the court from its creditors. Rossa Fanning SC, for CityJet, said some creditors were supporting the application.  The airline said it became insolvent arising out of financial difficulties which were exacerbated after its fleet of over 30 aircraft was grounded due to the Covid-19 outbreak.  The impact of the virus interrupted a planned merger with another airline and a proposed private restructuring of the company, it said.  James O’Doherty SC, for Mr Wallace, said, in the short time his client has been involved with the airline, there has been at least one expression of interest from a potential investor.  Mr Justice Quinn said he was confirming the examiner’s appointment on grounds including an independent expert’s report had stated the company has a reasonable prospect of survival if certain steps were taken.  The judge said the number of people employed in the company was a relevant factor. He noted, during its history, the company has overcome several challenges it has been presented with.  Support  While there was a lot of uncertainty as to exactly when air travel can resume, he noted the support CityJet had received from its main customer SAS.  SAS, on whose behalf CityJet operates several regional services, hopes there will be a gradual return to flying in June or July.  While there were no objections to the application to confirm the examiner’s appointment, the judge said he was satisfied to make orders sought by Revenue Commissioners, including to be made a notice party.  Revenue had raised concerns about the examinership application, and the court heard the company was answering Revenue’s questions.  The court heard the parties are in dispute over a €23 million tax demand made by Revenue on the airline for the years 2016, 2017 and 2018.  Those assessments, which CityJet says it does not have to pay, have been appealed to the Tax Appeals Commission by the airline.  The airline no longer flies scheduled routes itself, and has moved to a model known in the aviation industry known as wet leasing where it provides serviced aircraft and crews to operate routes for other carriers.  In each of the last three years the airline had revenues of over €220 million. It made a profit in 2017, but suffered significant losses in 2018 and 2019 due to various factors.  It has debts of €500 million and currently has a net deficit of liabilities over assets on a going concern basis of €186 million.  Its creditors include the Triangle Group, firms involved in the leasing of aircraft, Investec , the Revenue, as well as debts owed to related companies.  In order to counter its difficulties, plans had been put in place with its creditors to restructure the business and merge with Spanish airline Air Nostrum .	News
"Parson outlines 'Show Me Strong Recovery Plan' to reopen Missouri  27 Apr 2020, 15:00 by Glenn Minnis, The Center Square  Gov. Mike Parson is strategically building out his Show Me Strong Recovery Plan with hopes of a May 4 restart to the Missouri economy hit hard by the COVID-19 pandemic.  ""Between now and May 4, we will continue to monitor the situation and work with Missouri hospitals, health care providers, public health experts, business leaders and state departments to develop a plan, with the safety of Missourians at its core,” Parson said . “Our approach will be deliberate and data-driven.""  With Parson’s latest stay-at-home order slated to expire on that day, pillars of his plan include building testing capacity for the deadly virus, expansion of personal protective equipment, like masks, gloves and gowns, advancing the potential to predict future outbreaks and continuing to monitor hospital and health care systems' capacity for patient care.  Missouri Department of Health and Senior Services Director Dr. Randall Williams said the state can currently conduct up to 7,000 coronavirus tests per day with the potential to grow into meeting its stated goal of up to 10,000 every 24-hours.  Going forward, Williams said testing will move to ""looking at getting people back to work, seeing if they have immunity.""  Williams added that antibody testing is expected to be available before long and will be steered in the direction of specific geographic areas or among certain populations of people, like nursing home residents, to determine the prevalence of COVID-19.  With about 175 tests expected to be conducted per hour, he said, ""we're going to use that very strategically,"" in identifying people who suspect they’ve been exposed to the virus but aren’t certain."

Ó Murchú raises issue of local nursing homes in the Dáil - Talk of the Town  27 Apr 2020, 12:45 by TOTT Editor  Local TD Ruairí Ó Murchú has raised the issue of Dealgan Nursing Home and other similar facilities in the area in the Dáil.  The Sinn Féin TD has revealed today that he has submitted nine Parliamentary Questions about the situation which he hopes to receive answers to soon.  According to a report in yesterday’s Irish Daily Mail on Sunday, 17 people have so far lost their lives to Covid-19 in Dealgan House.  In a statement today Deputy Ó Murchú says the issue of Dealgan House, the operational control of which has been taken over by the RCSI Hospital Group since April 17th, “continues to cause huge anxiety in the community.”  Deputy Ó Murchú said he had been informed that staff and patients at the Dundalk home had been tested for Covid-19 a number of days ago and there were positives among the results.  There are, he said, increasing worries this week that as Covid-19 results come back for staff there may be “shortages at facilities, which could spark an ancillary crisis.”  He said: “This is because, I have been informed by nursing home owners, that there are no concrete plans in place from the HSE to deal with staff being off with Covid-19.”  The lack of clear communication with some families has also been raised by Deputy Ó Murchú who cited two cases where relatives of those in Dealgan Nursing Home contacted his office seeking assistance because ‘they felt they were not getting enough information from the hospital group about what was happening.’  He said: “In one instance, the family told me that their loved one, who is aged in their eighties, had been treated at a hospital earlier this week for an illness not related to Covid-19 and had tested negative for the virus.  “However, the family was deeply concerned about the situation their relative was going back into in Dealgan when they are discharged from hospital. They had sought advice about what their options were.  “In the second case, the family contacted our office to raise concerns about the segregation of residents who had tested positive for the virus. The relative concerned had a negative result, but told me their room was on the same corridor as those who have the virus.  “They were also concerned that they were told the same staff were looking after both negative and positive patients.”  Deputy Ó Murchú said he had written a number of times to the CEO of the RCSI Hospital Group, Ian Carter, about the families’ and other general concerns.     In an email to the local TD, Mr Carter said: “This involved the RCSI Hospital Group being responsible for ensuring necessary model of care through provision of appropriate nursing and medical staff, thereby ensuring residents’ wellbeing.”  The TD said he “hoped this meant that every and all measures were being taken by the hospital group to ensure the very best care for residents.”  Deputy Ó Murchú said: “The RCSI are now responsible here and I will continue to seek the answers to the concerns raised with me by staff and families.  “After everything that has gone on here, the very least that families, staff and residents can expect is clear communication from those who are now in charge of the situation. People shouldn’t have to come to a TD to try to get clarity about what is happening with a loved one at Dealgan, or any other nursing home.  “That has been one of the huge problems in this situation – the lack of clear, precise communication – not only between nursing home management and families, but also between the HSE, and the private nursing home sector.”  The newly-elected TD said he had spoken to owners of other private nursing homes in Louth over the last few days and “it was clear that some had to take their own steps to ensure they had enough Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) and to close the facilities to visitors, ahead of the HSE advising them to.”  In addition, Nursing Homes Ireland have raised concerns about how older people were transferred out of acute hospital settings into care facilities and whether a comprehensive testing regime was in place at that early stage.  There are, he said, a number of serious outstanding issues including testing regimes, the supply and use of PPE and staffing levels when carers and nurses are off sick.  He said there had been ‘ample’ warning from other states’ experiences of Covid-19 which showed that older people were at a much higher risk but “it was clear the HSE and the Department of Health had not prioritised nursing homes early enough.”  He concluded: :Last week, figures from the National Public Health Emergency Team showed a rise in the numbers of people who have died in nursing homes in the State from the virus – it rose from 276 on Monday April 20 to 348 on April 22. A further 102 residents were also suspected to have died from Covid-19.  “These numbers highlight the severity of the situation that has been allowed to develop in our nursing homes.”  The questions posed by Deputy Ó Murchú are as follows:   To ask the Minister for Health what measures are in place to maintain a proper and safe staffing level in private nursing homes if staff are off sick due to Covid-19 and if he will make a statement on the matter?  To ask the Minister for Health what infection control protocols are being used in HSE run nursing homes where Covid-19 is present or suspected and if he will make a statement on the matter?  To ask the Minister for Health what infection control protocols are being used in private nursing homes where Covid-19 is present or suspected and if he will make a statement on the matter?  To ask the Minister for Health if he is aware what categories of Personal Protective Equipment and exactly how much of each category has been supplied to private nursing homes by the State and if he will make a statement on the matter?  To ask the Minister for Health what training has been provided to staff in private nursing homes in the correct use of Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) and if he will make a statement on the matter?  To ask the Minister for Health if final year nursing students can expect their nursing registrations to be completed by June 2020 and if he will make a statement on the matter?  To ask the Minister for Health that, in the case of Dealgan House Nursing Home in Dundalk, Co Louth, the operation of which was taken over by the RCSI Hospital Group on April 17 2020, what is the management structure now at the facility and who is in operational control at the home?  To ask the Minister for Health what infection control protocols are being used in private nursing homes where Covid-19 has not been detected, and if he will make a statement on the matter?  To ask the Minister for Health what infection control protocols are being used in HSE nursing homes where Covid-19 has not been detected and if he will make a statement on the matter?	NotNews
"New Zealand says it has 'won the battle' against coronavirus  27 Apr 2020, 12:23 by Justin Wise  The New Zealand government proclaimed on Monday that the country has reached its goal of eliminating the coronavirus after reporting just four new ""probable cases"" of COVID-19 and one death over the weekend.  ""There is no widespread undetected community transmission in New Zealand,"" Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern said at a news conference, according to reports . ""We have won that battle. But we must remain vigilant if we are to keep it that way.""  Ashley Bloomfield, New Zealand's director general of health, said that the small number of cases gave health officials ""confidence that we've achieved our goal of elimination."" She added that elimination never meant complete ""eradication"" of the disease, but rather a point where health care workers felt confident about where infections were emerging.  ""Our goal is elimination,"" Bloomfield said. ""And again, that doesn't mean eradication but it means we get down to a small number of cases so that we are able to stamp out any cases and any outbreak that might come out.""  New Zealand's Ministry of Health has reported 1,122 confirmed total cases of COVID-19, the disease caused by the novel coronavirus, and 19 deaths from it. The agency said Monday that it had reported just one confirmed COVID-19 case in the previous 24 hours.  Ardern announced that the government would gradually lift restrictions on travel and businesses. New Zealand moved from a ""level four"" to "" level three "" alert on Monday, which allowed businesses to partially reopen with some restrictions. The advisory still requires people to socially distance while outside of their home.  The advisory also allows schools to reopen under modified conditions. Public venues, such as gyms and libraries, will remain closed. Ardern said that the government would reassess the restrictions on May 11.  ""It's been nearly five weeks living and working in ways that just two months ago would have been impossible. But we did. And we have done it together,"" Ardern added."	News

I've Tried So Many Blue Light Glasses, and Drew Barrymore's Are Simply the Best  27 Apr 2020, 12:00 by Victoria Moorhouse     I've read that there's no sound scientific studies (yet) that prove that the blue light our computer screens emit is definitively damaging to our eyes , and I believe what science tells me. But, I've also tried enough blue light glasses to know that in terms of lens color, style, and comfort, some are definitely better than others.  My story with testing blue light glasses began because I was dealing with aggravating headaches and eye fatigue at work — what I assumed was digital eye strain.  In terms of digital eye-strain treatment, the American Academy of Ophthalmology doesn't recommend blue light glasses, but as more and more of my friends started using them (and swearing by them for reducing their headaches), I decided to give them a personal test run.  A few weird lens colors (that almost made me squint more!) and heavy frames later, I had all but given up on my search for blue light glasses — and then I discovered Drew Barrymore 's FLOWER by Drew Eyewear Blue-Light Blocking Glasses .  They are simply the best.  Let's start with affordability. Most of the blue light glasses that I've tried run somewhere in the $50-$100 range. FLOWER by Drew Blue Light Glasses, which also block UV rays, ring in at ($20), around the same price as a pair of budget sunglasses.  They're available in three different rounded frames, Violet, Daily, and Marigold. In Violet, there are four different colors to choose from, while Marigold and Daisy offer two different shade options each.  I picked Marigold Tiger Eye Tort ($20), and if I ever need to start wearing prescription glasses in the future, this minimalistic pair of tortoiseshell glasses is exactly what I'd want.  Unlike many blue light glasses I've tried, these have scratch-resistant, yellow-tinted lenses. According to the brand, the yellow tint is responsible for absorbing the blue light, and the glasses block 40 percent of the blue light from reaching the eye.  Personally, I think the yellow tint makes the light from my computer a little less harsh, especially when my eyes are feeling achy and fatigued — I prefer staring at my countless Google docs while wearing them.  Lightweight and well-fitting, I forget they're even on my face most days. The scratch-resistant quality is worth applauding, too, as I've retired a pair of blue light glasses solely due to accidental etchings.  I can't speak to any headaches being relieved (thankfully because I haven't had any), but in terms of screen staring, I feel as though they soften the entire experience.  And for that, I'm a FLOWER by Drew blue light glasses believer.  Click here for more health and wellness stories, tips, and news .  Image Source: FLOWER by Drew	NotNews

Eurostat: 41.6% of the Bulgarians are Living in Overcrowded Households   27 Apr 2020, 13:41   In the European Union (EU), 17.1% of the population were living in overcrowded households in 2018, meaning they did not have enough rooms compared to the size of the household. Although merrier, overcrowded households can feel even smaller with kids playing in the same room as parents trying to telework during the coronavirus lockdown. Moreover, overcrowded environments can present a higher risk of spreading the virus.  On the other hand, staying home alone for days on end brings its own set of challenges as well. In the EU, more than one in three persons (33.0%) lived in under-occupied dwellings in 2018, meaning that the dwellings were deemed to be too large, in terms of excess rooms and more specifically bedrooms, for the needs of the household living in it.  Overcrowding rate falling slightly in countries with the highest rates  Among the EU Member States, almost half the population in Romania (46.3%) were living in overcrowded households in 2018. This was also the case for around two in every five persons in Latvia (43.4%), Bulgaria (41.6%), Croatia (39.3%) and Poland (39.2%). Compared to the previous year, the share of the population living in overcrowded dwellings fell slightly in all of these countries except Latvia (+1.5 percentage points), with the strongest fall recorded in Poland (-1.3 pp).  At the opposite end of the scale, the lowest overcrowding rates were recorded in Cyprus (2.5%), Ireland (2.7%), Malta (3.4%) and the Netherlands (4.1%).  The share of young people and children that live in overcrowded dwellings is much higher than for the elderly. In 2018, almost one quarter (24.1%) of people aged 18 year or less lived in overcrowded dwellings in the EU, while only 6.9% of those aged 65 years and older did. In particular, 40.2% of young people in the EU who were living in households at risk of poverty were also living in overcrowded dwellings, Eurosta t data shows.  Seven in ten persons living in under-occupied dwellings in Malta, Ireland and Cyprus  In 2018, almost three quarters of the population were living in under-occupied dwellings in Malta (73.4%), Ireland and Cyprus (both 71.4%). In Belgium (58.6%), Spain (56.3%), the Netherlands (53.9%) and Luxembourg (53.7%), more than half of the population were living in dwellings deemed too large. From 2017 to 2018, the largest drops in share of the population living in under-occupied dwellings were recorded in Luxembourg (-1.8 percentage points), Denmark (-1.7 pp) and Sweden (-1.0 pp).  In contrast, less than 15% of the population were living in dwellings deemed to be too large in Romania (7.3%), Latvia (9.9%), Greece (10.4%), Bulgaria (11.5%), Croatia (11.6%), Slovakia (12.7%), Poland (14.4%) and Italy (14.9%).  Close to half of the people aged 65 year or older (46.9%) in the EU were living in under-occupied dwellings in 2018. This was the case for a vast majority of elderly people in Ireland (92.8%), Cyprus (87.4%) and Malta (86.7%), while relatively few elderly lived in dwellings with too many rooms in Romania (12.0%), Latvia (13.3%), Croatia (16.9%) and Poland (17.8%).

Haryana Police warns people of cyber frauds during lockdown  According to Virk, some cyber fraudsters are circulating malware link regarding COVID-19 to confidential data including password from the receiver’s phone or computer, as and when opened.  27 Apr 2020, 14:06 by Express News Service  In the wake of COVID-19 lockdown, the Haryana Police has issued an advisory requesting people not to share any personal information or respond to suspicious links on WhatsApp or email as it could result in funds being siphoned off from their bank accounts.  Issuing an advisory, Additional Director General of Police (Law and Order), Navdeep Singh Virk said, “Cyber criminals may dupe people by asking them to donate for COVID-19 through fake UPI IDs which are similar to UPI ID used by the Prime Minister’s Citizens Assistance and Relief in Emergency Situation (PM-CARES) Fund. Similarly, they can seek funds through social media by creating fake bank account of COVID-19. It has been advised that people should not transfer money to any unverified account published in social platforms”.  He added: “Some of the other modus operandi include seeking bank details on the guise of fraudulent schemes on face masks/sanitizers via fake online shopping sites, committing frauds by creating a fake page similar to government websites, offering coronavirus protection kits by online shopping windows and seeking OTP for home delivery of goods”, the advisory adds.

"Judge grants emergency barring order against 'volatile' husband after threat to kill wife   27 Apr 2020, 14:41   A judge has granted an emergency order to a woman for the removal of her husband from the family home after the judge heard of the husband's repeated threats to kill his wife.  At a sitting of the family court in Ennis, Judge Patrick Durcan granted the Interim Barring Order (IBO) to the woman after hearing that her husband has threatened to kill his wife on a number of occasions.  In her statement seeking the order read out by Judge Durcan, the woman stated her husband has been “physically and emotionally abusive to me for the last five years”.  She stated: “He has beaten me up on many occasions throughout our marriage. Three weeks ago, he beat me up and tried to strangle me. He threatened to kill me. I called the gardaí as I feared for my life.""  She added: “He has tried to strangle me on a few occasions throughout our marriage and there are constant threats to kill me. He is very violent. He shouts and screams at me and is very aggressive in the house.  'Immediate risk of significant harm'  ""He throws bottles and objects and this scares me.”  The woman stated that “there is an immediate risk of significant harm to me if the order is not made immediately and the granting of a protection order would not be sufficient"".  The woman told Judge Durcan that she was fearful of this man.  Judge Durcan told the woman that after she receives a copy of the interim barring order, she is to then bring it to the gardaí who will serve it on her husband.

She stated: “I can’t sleep because I can’t change the locks and he comes and goes as he pleases. I have no idea what is going to happen next.”  She added: “He is now convinced that I am seeing someone else and is constantly harassing all the kids. I have no idea what he will do next but I am genuinely fearful for my safety when he is drunk. He is unpredictable and very volatile.”  In a separate case, Judge Durcan granted a protection order to a woman after she told him that her ex-partner is sending her abusive messages.  She stated that over a recent three day period, she received 190 notifications from him made up of 175 messages and the remainder were missed calls.  She stated: “Some of these messages are abusive and some are declaring war.”  She added: “I often don’t open the messages as they can be very abusive calling me names and criticising me.”  READ MORE   Three-year jail term for knife-attack teenager who did not want uncle buying heroin for his father"	News

Almajiris repatriated from kano tests positive for COVID-19 in Kaduna  27 Apr 2020, 14:16 by Abdulganiyu Alabi, Kaduna  The Kaduna State Commissioner for Health, Dr Amina Mohammed-Baloni has confirmed five new cases of Covid-19 in the state.  She said, “the new cases are among Almajirai who were recently repatriated from Kano.”  Baloni said in a statement that there are now nine active cases in the state.  The commissioner, however, maintained that contacts of the new cases are being traced so that they can be monitored and tested if they meet the case definition.  She said the new patients have been moved to the Infectious Diseases Control Centre, the state’s premier isolation centre.  “Our medical professionals are treating them with the same high standards and we wish all our nine active cases speedy recovery.  “Testing capacity has improved in the state. Two labs, one each in Kaduna and Zaria, have been accredited by NCDC to conduct Covid-19 tests.  “The Ministry of Health wishes to remind the general public of the importance of hand-washing, personal hygiene, social distancing and the avoidance of large gatherings in helping protect us all from Covid-19. It is important to stay home, stay safe and save lives,” Baloni urged Kaduna residents.	News
"A 'very pro-growth' agenda will be tricky to sell  27 Apr 2020, 14:00 by Shane Wright  When Scott Morrison declared the government was going to put in place economic policies that were ""very pro-growth"", it prompted an obvious question.  What sort of economic policies had the government in place before the advent of the coronavirus pandemic? Were they not very pro-growth, only pro-growth or maybe just fair to middling growth?  It was the economic version of Spinal Tap and the amplifier that goes to 11.    Going to ""very pro-growth policies"". The policy agenda has been turned up to 11. This is Spinal Tap   The concept behind the slogan – of finding ways to get the economy zooming along post-virus – is absolutely spot on. Policies will be needed to help the hundreds of thousands of Australians tossed out of work, to assist businesses fighting for survival and to pay down the government debt left by the virus battle. The way to do that is to get the economy growing strongly.  Looking at how the economy was performing before the virus, it's hard to argue the government's existing policy agenda was shooting out the financial lights.  Just days after last year's federal election, Reserve Bank governor Philip Lowe used a speech to signal interest rate cuts while calling on a policy overhaul. By year's end, rates were at a then-record low of 0.75 per cent and the government had put in place its own $4.8 billion infrastructure package.  With official interest rates now effectively at zero, and the RBA signalling they'll be around that level for several years, there's no chance of ultra-loose monetary policy juicing the economy in the foreseeable future.  That puts the heavy lifting on government policy. Hence Morrison's demand for ""very pro-growth"" policies which, unsurprisingly, saw the usual suspects fall back on their usual agendas.  Businesses immediately went to company tax cuts and industrial relations reform while on the Left the arguments went to cutting tax concessions or spending up more on social services.  Both sides seemed to have ignored the past decade of sluggish growth, itself an illustration of the damage caused by the global financial crisis, and the longer-term problems created by the coronavirus pandemic.  Growing the economy is pivotal to cutting unemployment and the government's mountain of debt, which is now at a record high of almost $600 billion. Many have looked at how debt – around 120 per cent of GDP – left after World War Two was paid off.  In the 14 years between 1946 and 1960, the economy swelled by 85 per cent. Inflation averaged almost 7 per cent a year while the population grew by 39 per cent on the back of the post-war baby boom and a bipartisan immigration program that transformed the country. Our war debt shrank within two decades.  Today's world is much different. Over the past 14 years the economy has grown by just 40 per cent. Inflation has averaged 2.4 per cent while the population has swelled by a quarter or more than 5 million. Our debt levels are lower (partly thanks to the Howard-Costello years of strong tax revenues and asset sales) but economic and population growth have been much more subdued while inflation has all but disappeared.  If it wasn't for the population growth of the past 14 years the economy would actually have been much smaller. But the government started its policy this financial year to put a 160,000 cap on the nation's immigration intake. At this stage it is unlikely to be reached, in part because people overseas are locked down.  Add in the sharp fall in international students and temporary workers due to the coronavirus restrictions and there's no chance of a surge in immigration to bolster the economy.  Last week, Morrison highlighted the Productivity Commission's three-year-old Shifting the Dial report as a blueprint of reform.  Since 2017 it has been collecting dust but now, with our attention focused on a post-virus world, the heart of the commission's report around health, education and inter-government relations – and promised returns of up to $80 billion a year – is back on the agenda.  But most are politically dicey across the left-right divide and with several hornet's nests worth of vested interests. Just one of the proposals to overhaul how drugs are dispensed, introduce a carbon price or shift to user-charges for our roads could be worth a monumental scare campaign on its own.  There is a very pro-growth agenda. Whether our political leaders have taken anything from the past few months will determine if it is actually put in place."	News
Howard Stern Reacts To Trump: ‘I Would Love It If Donald Would Get On TV And Take An Injection Of Clorox’  27 Apr 2020, 22:41 by Shakiel Mahjouri  Howard Stern is livid with U.S. President Donald Trump after the latter brought up the theory of injecting disinfectant to help fight off COVID-19.  Trump later claimed his remark was sarcasm and the whole situation has infuriated Stern. The iconic radio host reacted to Trump’s comments in a fiery speech on Monday’s episode of his SiriusXM program.     “I would love it if Donald would get on TV and take an injection of Clorox and let’s see if his theory works,” Stern said, according to the New York Daily New s . “Hold a big rally, say f**k this coronavirus, with all of his followers, and let them hug each other and kiss each other and have a big rally.”  His co-host Robin Quivers added, “A big cocktail of disinfectant,” to which Stern replied, “Yeah. And all take [a] disinfectant and all drop dead.”  Stern also engaged in a back-and-forth with callers     “I’m very frustrated. It is mind-blowing to me. We have such a disconnect in this country — this [caller] is saying he saw that and he’s OK with it,” Stern argued per The Hollywood Reporter . “What’s it going to take? I don’t get it.”  “I am all in on Joe Biden,” he responded to one caller who accused Stern of expressing favouritism towards the Democratic presidential candidate. “You see the wall that’s right next to you, I’ll vote for the wall over a guy who tells me that I should pour Clorox into my mouth. Listen, I think we are in deep s**t. I think we could have been ahead of this curve.”  After Trump’s comments, Lysol issued a warning not to consume disinfectants: “As a global leader in health and hygiene products, we must be clear that under no circumstance should our disinfectant products be administered into the human body (through injection, ingestion or any other route).”   Watch Video    Related	NotNews
"Conservatives gear up to grill government over new COVID-19 measures  27 Apr 2020, 22:05 by Stephanie Levitz The Canadian Press Staff Contact  OTTAWA -- Conservative Leader Andrew Scheer laid out Monday the numerous lines of inquiry his party intends to follow this week as a modified version of a House of Commons sitting gets underway.  They include the state of the nation's emergency supply stockpile, the mishmash of federal economic benefit programs that allow some to fall through the cracks and to what extent the minority Liberals are backstopping provincial efforts to reopen their economies, Scheer said.  ""It is incumbent on the prime minister to immediately present Canadians with a plan outlining how his government will support provinces and territories as they revise health restrictions over and above the national guidelines that are currently being developed,"" Scheer said.     Newsletter sign-up: Get The COVID-19 Brief sent to your inbox      MPs are about to convene their first special virtual sitting. What does that involve?     Though described by the prime minister Monday as the first virtual sitting of Parliament, what's actually happening Tuesday is the first meeting of a special committee struck to somewhat mirror the routine of the House of Commons.  Parliament itself is adjourned until late May, following its first postponement in mid-March due to the near-countrywide shutdown in an effort to slow the spread of the novel coronavirus.  All-party consensus had been required to keep it closed past April 20. The Opposition Conservatives wanted a return to four days of sittings, albeit with a much smaller group than the 338 MPs who make up the House of Commons.  But the NDP and Bloc Quebecois agreed to support the Liberals' proposal of the committee, with its two virtual and one in-person sittings each week.  All 338 MPs are on the committee, but only seven are required for quorum, as opposed to the 20 for a normal sitting of the Commons. The meetings will focus largely, if not exclusively, on the COVID-19 response for between two and five hours a day.  As Scheer calls for a Liberal plan, behind closed doors his caucus is also drawing up what a conservative approach to getting the economy back on track would look like.  The Conservative caucus coronavirus response and recovery committee is led by deputy party leader Leona Alleslev, who said the intent is to help provide more structure to the Opposition as it takes on the Liberals in the coming months.  Alleslev said the Conservatives are helping to govern the country in these uncertain times, even if they are one of the opposition parties.  ""Our role is to do that thinking, as much as to respond what the government presents, to understand how we would do it differently and that's whether you're in a minority or a majority.""  One Conservative's approach to the government's COVID-19 response drew heated criticism late last week.  Derek Sloan, an MP also running for leadership of the Conservatives, asked whether chief public health officer Dr. Theresa Tam was working ""for China or Canada,"" a question that drew accusations of racism given she was born in Hong Kong.  Scheer had initially refused to address Sloan's remarks, saying he would not discuss ideas put forward by leadership candidates. The backlash they prompted, including by Conservatives, saw him clarify Monday that he does not agree with Sloan's characterization, nor does the Conservative caucus.  ""It is not appropriate to question someone's loyalty to their country. I believe that is a very serious accusation that you have to have some very substantial evidence to make,"" Scheer said.  Scheer said the Conservatives' position is Tam can't be the scapegoat for the government's approach to COVID-19, and it is the government only that can be held accountable on that score.  Scheer suggested Sloan will face no repercussions for his comments within caucus. Party members who will cast a ballot in the leadership race are the ones who will ultimately decide on Sloan's political fate, he said.  That race is currently on pause as the vote organizers decide how and when it can proceed. A meeting to do so is scheduled for Friday.  This report by The Canadian Press was first published April 27, 2020."	News
"Steven Gerrard must feel 'terrible' about infamous title slip, says Demba Ba  27 Apr 2020, 22:58 by Gareth Bicknell  Former Chelsea striker Demba Ba says Steven Gerrard must be haunted by the slip which cost him his best chance of winning the Premier League title with Liverpool .  Anfield legend Gerrard won almost every club trophy possible during his 17 years with Liverpool - but a league winner's medal always eluded him.  Gerrard's best chance of skippering his side to Premier League glory came during the 2013/4 season, when Liverpool needed just seven points from their final three games to seal the title after winning 11 games in a row.  But he infamously slipped during a pivotal Anfield clash against Chelsea , allowing Ba to run through and score, setting up a victory for the Londoners which effectively cost the Reds the crown.  Chelsea defended their lead brilliantly before Willian added a second late on to secure the three points, with Manchester City pipping Liverpool to the title by winning their final five games.    Gerrard distraught after Chelsea's win over Liverpool at Anfield six years ago (Image: Getty Images)   And on the sixth anniversary of the fateful game, Senagal striker Ba says Gerrard must feel terrible about the slip-up.  ""I think it must be difficult to live with,"" the 34-year-old told Sky Sports.  ""You know if I put myself in his shoes, which I really didn't up until now, but it must be terrible for a player that played so long for one team and that has played so great for one team, basically losing a title on a mistake that he has done.  ""Of course (I have) a degree of sympathy, yeah maybe. I'm not really thinking about it too much.""    Demba Ba gives Chelsea the lead after Gerrard's infamous slip (Image: Kent Gavin Daily Mirror)   Gerrard's slip has prompted plenty of trolling over the years from fans of rival teams, delighting in the irony of such a costly gaffe from a player who inspired his team to glory so many times.  He started Liverpool's stunning fightback from 3-0 down to win the 2005 Champions League final on penalties against AC Milan, in what became known as 'The Miracle of Istanbul'.  A year later, Gerrard scored twice as the Reds came back from 2-0 down against West Ham in the FA Cup final, with the skipper's two equalisers securing a 3-3 draw before another shoot-out victory.  That was his second FA Cup triumph with Liverpool, while he also won the UEFA Cup, the UEFA Super Cup, three League Cups and the Community Shield.   Mirror Football's Top Stories"	NotNews

"Half of US states easing coronavirus restrictions as jobless numbers grow  The enormous pressure on states to reopen, despite a lack of wide-scale virus testing and other safeguards urged by health experts, was highlighted in new Labor Department data showing some 30 million Americans have sought unemployment benefits since March 21.  01 May 2020, 03:29 by Reuters    The jobless toll amounts to more than 18.4% of the U.S. working-age population, a level not seen since the Great Depression of the 1930s. AFP   WASHINGTON/NEW YORK: The White House let its 2-week-old economic reopening guidelines expire on Thursday as half of all U.S. states forged ahead with their own strategies for easing restrictions on restaurants, retail and other businesses shuttered by the coronavirus crisis.  The enormous pressure on states to reopen, despite a lack of wide-scale virus testing and other safeguards urged by health experts, was highlighted in new Labor Department data showing some 30 million Americans have sought unemployment benefits since March 21.  The jobless toll amounts to more than 18.4% of the U.S. working-age population, a level not seen since the Great Depression of the 1930s.  Physical separation of people - by closing schools, businesses and other places of social gatherings - remains the chief weapon against a highly contagious respiratory virus with no vaccine and no cure.  But with economic pain reaching historic proportions, agitation to relax stay-at-home orders and mandatory workplace restrictions has mounted.  For the second time in two weeks, hundreds of protesters - including armed militia group members - thronged Michigan's state Capitol in Lansing demanding an end to Governor Gretchen Whitmer's stay-at-home orders.  The latest protest was sparked by the Democratic governor's request, ignored by Republican lawmakers, to extend emergency powers she had invoked in a state hard hit by both the virus and closures to combat it.  WHITE HOUSE STEPS BACK Weeks after insisting he had ""total"" authority to decide when and how to reopen the nation's economy, President Donald Trump has largely left it to each governor to decide on a state-by-state basis.  Although the White House declined to extend its April 16 reopening guidance, which recommended an economic restart in stages only after strict precautions are put in place, medical experts said those conditions remained unmet and that acting prematurely risked a resurgence of the outbreak.  Safely lifting social distancing rules, they insisted, will require vastly expanded virus screening and the means to trace close social contacts of infected people so they too can be tested and isolated.  ""You can't just leap over things to a situation where you're really tempting (the virus) to rebound. That's the thing I get concerned about,"" Dr. Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, told NBC's ""Today"" show.  In a breakthrough announced Wednesday that could prove to be a national model, Los Angeles County became the first major U.S. metropolitan area offering free coronavirus tests for all, though high demand has strained the website for sign-ups.  The tests, funded in part with a Rockefeller Foundation grant through a charity co-founded by actor Sean Penn, are to be made available by appointment to anyone in the county of roughly 10 million residents - the most populous in the nation.  Across the country, New York Governor Andrew Cuomo said his state would hire thousands of workers for the labor-intensive job of tracking down human contacts of individuals who test positive for the virus.  As of Thursday, the number of known infections nationwide had climbed to well over 1 million, including more than 62,000 deaths, far exceeding the tally of American war dead from all the years of U.S. military involvement in Vietnam.  But pressures to return to some semblance of normalcy have only grown as the outbreak appears to have waned across much of the county.  PATCHWORK OF STATES About two dozen states, mostly in the South, the Midwest and mountain West, have moved to relax restrictions since Georgia led the way late last week. Texas and Florida, among others this week, outlined plans for doing so in the days ahead.  But no companies are required to reopen, and it was not clear how many business owners and their employees would return to work, and how many patrons would venture back into stores and restaurants.  The number of coronavirus cases is still climbing in many parts of the country, although peaks appear to have been reached in New York state, the epicenter of the U.S. outbreak, and other places.  Pennsylvania, Kansas, Wisconsin, Virginia, Arizona, Minnesota and Nebraska all reported a record number of new cases on Thursday, though greater testing could account for some of the increases, revealing infections already present but undetected.  Several states, including New Jersey, Texas, Massachusetts, Ohio, Indiana, West Virginia and New Mexico, posted new highs in their daily death tolls.  New Jersey Governor Phil Murphy, who plans to reopen state parks and golf courses on Saturday, paid a visit to the White House on Thursday. Afterward he said the federal government was giving his state 550,000 coronavirus testing kits, along with 750,000 swabs to take samples, marking a ""huge step"" toward his goal of doubling New Jersey's testing capacity by late May.  In California, Governor Gavin Newsom announced beach and park closures in Orange County, south of Los Angeles, after crowds jammed the popular shoreline last weekend.  Newsom, a Democrat, has said that curbside retail, manufacturing and other ""lower-risk workplaces"" should reopen in California within weeks as testing and contact-tracing improve.  In one of the first major reopenings anticipated in U.S. sports, NASCAR announced its auto racing competition would return with 10 races at its North and South Carolina tracks in mid- to late-May.  Some segments of the commercial U.S. workforce kept on the job during the health crisis have begun to push back against what they see as deteriorating conditions.  Workers at leading retailers including Amazon, Walmart and Target, as well as delivery service Instacart and FedEx, were planning strikes on Friday to protest a lack of safety equipment and other protections at a time when their services are deemed essential, according to information circulated on social media."

Amitabh Bachchan on Rishi Kapoor: Certain that he must have gone with a gentle smile  Bollywood megastar Amitabh Bachchan took to his blog on Thursday evening to pay tribute to his friend Rishi Kapoor.  01 May 2020, 03:07 by Sana Farzeen  Bollywood star Rishi Kapoor breathed his last on Thursday after a prolonged battle with cancer . His frequent collaborator and good friend Amitabh Bachchan broke the news on social media in the morning as he tweeted, “T 3517 – He’s GONE .. ! Rishi Kapoor .. gone .. just passed away .. I am destroyed!”  Late Thursday, the Bollywood megastar took to his blog to pay tribute to his friend.  Titled “in Memoriam”, Amitabh Bachchan started the note remembering his first meeting with Rishi Kapoor, even before the latter became an actor. He wrote, “I had seen him at his home Deonar Cottage, Chembur, a young energetic, bubbly, mischief in his eyes Chintu, on those rare moments when I was privileged to have been invited to an evening at Raj ji’s house..”  Big B added, “I would see him more often after, at RK Studios, when he trained as an actor for his film to be made, BOBBY.. a diligent enthusiastic youngster, ready to pounce onto every learning that came his way, in that famous large and legendary make up room, of Raj ji at the end of the first floor corridor of make up rooms..”  Further in the blog post, Amitabh Bachchan remarked how Rishi Kapoor’s stride and style resembled his grandfather Prithviraj Kapoor’s. He wrote, “He had a walk that was confident and determined.. a stride and style that was similar to that of his grandfather, the legendary Prithvi Raj ji.. a walk I had noticed in one of his earlier films.. that walk .. I never found it in any other ..”  Bachchan and Kapoor have worked together in films like Amar Akbar Anthony, Naseeb, Kabhi Kabhie, Ajooba and more recently 102 Not Out.  “When he spoke his lines, you believed every word of it .. there was never an alternative .. its genuineness was beyond question.. And there has never been any other, that could lip sync a song as perfectly as he would .. never ..,” Amitabh Bachchan recalled.    Rishi Kapoor’s favourite photos from Express Archive    Remembering his friend’s loving nature, the 77-year-old stated, “.. even in the most grave sequences he would discover that comedic spark and we would all just crack up.. ! Not just on set.. if you were with him at any formal event, he would find that little distractive light hearted gem to expand on and lighten the situation ..”  Rishi Kapoor’s friends have previously mentioned his love for board games, and Big B too mentioned about it in his post. He shared, “When there was a time lapse as the shot got readied during a shoot, he would bring out his playing cards, or at times pull out his rather complicated Bagatelle board and invite others to play.. a competition.. not just for fun.. a serious competition..”  Rishi Kapoor was diagnosed with cancer in 2018, and he spent more than 11 months in New York for the treatment.  Sharing that Kapoor was always positive of recovery, Bachchan wrote, “During his time of diagnosis and his treatment he never ever lamented his condition.. it was always .. ‘see you soon, just a routine visit to the Hospital .. I’ll be back shortly’. Joie de vivre .. the exuberant enjoyment of life, was a gene he inherited from his father.. the Legend, the Ultimate Showman the Iconic Raj Kapoor .”   Also Read | Rishi Kapoor passes away | Rishi Kapoor: The singing-dancing-romancing hero we all loved to love | Celebrities mourn the demise of Rishi Kapoor | 102 Not Out director Umesh Shukla on Rishi Kapoor: He truly was magic | ‘Rishi Kapoor wanted to fly a chopper, but Nasir Hussain didn’t let him’: Air Force officer remembers | Everything Rishi Kapoor said about his cancer treatment | The best films of Rishi Kapoor’s second innings | Alia Bhatt pays tribute to Rishi Kapoor | Shah Rukh Khan fondly remembers his first co-star Rishi Kapoor | 15 movies of Rishi Kapoor you can watch online | 10 best songs of Rishi Kapoor | Everything you should know about Rishi Kapoor | From the archives – Rishi Kapoor: I got the best break in Bobby, but it all went downhill from there   Amitabh Bachchan also revealed the reason for not visiting Rishi Kapoor during his treatment.

Pandemic sees global smartphone shipments fall dramatically in Q1  New research shows shipments fell below 300 million for the quarter, a first since 2014  01 May 2020, 05:21 by Henry Burrell  A new report from analyst firm Counterpoint Research states that the smartphone market has declined by 13% year on year, the fastest rate ever. Global smartphone shipments for Q1 2020 fell below to 295m, the first time quarterly shipments have fallen below 300m since Q1 2014.  While smartphone shipments declined gradually in 2019, the report said that “The COVID-19 pandemic has disrupted the signs of any recovery that the market started showing in Q4 2019.”  It goes on to say that “The first quarter decline was mainly driven by a 27% YoY shipment decline in China”, where the global market share fell from 26% to 22%.  Tarun Pathak, Associate Director at Counterpoint Research said, “From the consumer standpoint, unless replacing a broken phone, smartphones are mostly a discretionary purchase. Consumers, under these uncertain times, are likely to withhold making many significant discretionary purchases. This means the replacement cycles are likely to become longer. Lockdowns in most parts of the world will be lifted in a staggered way, which will mean it could take time before the retail activity completely resumes. Even after the lockdown ends, there will likely be changes consumer spending patterns.”  Samsung remained the biggest selling smartphone manufacturer with 59m units sold in Q1 2020, but that was down significantly from 72m from Q1 2019. Despite still having a 20% global share of sales overall, Counterpoint expects “a steeper decline in Q2 2020”.  Huawei, Apple, Xiaomi and Oppo make up the rest of the top five vendors, with only Xiaomi seeing a year on year rise in sales, as shown in the below graphic.    Image: Counterpoint Research   Xiaomi’s sub-brand Realme also saw growth, showing the rise in the brands’ popularity in emerging markets such as India. Counterpoint’s research suggested the figures could be explained by India’s lockdown only coming in the last week of March, meaning sales remained stronger there compared to other regions.  The news comes the day after Apple posted its financial results , which include iPhone sales, where it notably still brought in more revenue than the same fiscal quarter last year despite the coronavirus pandemic.

FBR’s collection slumps 17% in April  01 May 2020, 02:41 by Shahbaz Rana  ISLAMABAD: The tax collection in April slumped 16.5% to only Rs242.5 billion due to partial lockdown in the country as the government also reshuffled the top hierarchy of the Federal Board of Revenue (FBR).  The FBR notified transfers and postings of about 53 officers and at least two of them with serious reputational issues are being given key positions in the field that may not bode well with the image of the Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) government.  The government has appointed officers with a tainted reputation a week after Prime Minister Imran Khan approved rules for “forced retirement” of civil servants, who have become deadwood. But it seems that the bureaucracy is not listening to the prime minister.  In April, the FBR provisionally collected Rs242.5 billion in taxes, down by Rs48 billion or 16.5% when compared with the collection in the same month of last year. April’s downward-revised tax collection target was Rs426 billion, which the FBR missed by a wide margin of Rs186 billion.  However, the tax targets have become irrelevant due to the fast-changing economic situation in the aftermath of the Covid-19 pandemic that started affecting Pakistan’s economy from the fourth week of March. But the FBR’s performance remained below the benchmark throughout the fiscal year.  From July through April of the current fiscal year, the FBR provisionally collected Rs3.307 trillion. Its collection was Rs908 billion less than the original target.  The government and the International Monetary Fund (IMF) now expect the FBR to collect at least Rs3.9 trillion, which will be slightly higher than the Rs3.83 trillion collected in the last fiscal year.  FBR management is trying to justify its poor performance by hiding behind the Covid-19 situation. The deadly pandemic will dent FBR’s collection in the April-June period. In the pre-Covid-19 situation, the FBR had sustained a shortfall of Rs693 billion. Business activities remained largely suspended in April, which became the reason for the 16.5% dip in revenue collection as compared to Rs290 billion received in the same month of the previous year.  The Rs3.307-trillion collection was higher by 10.4% or Rs312 billion as compared to the same period of the previous fiscal year.  On the insistence of the IMF, the federal government had initially set the FBR’s tax collection target at Rs5.5 trillion or 12.4% of gross domestic product (GDP).  The IMF’s target was unrealistic as it required a 45% growth in the collection from last year’s Rs3.829 trillion. The IMF then forced Pakistan to take unprecedented revenue measures of Rs735 billion.  But now public finances are expected to come under significant pressure. The IMF has projected that the budget deficit is expected to be 9.2% of GDP in this fiscal year due to a decline in tax revenue and an increase in public spending to support the healthcare response to the Covid-19 and social safety nets for the very poor.  However, the IMF expects the budget deficit will improve to some extent and will be around 6.2% of GDP in the next fiscal year, as it has proposed an Rs5.1-trillion tax collection target.  The Rs5.1-trillion target will be 31% higher than the estimated collection in this fiscal year, which will again make it challenging for the FBR to achieve.  The low revenue collection will have serious implications for the country’s debt, which the IMF has now projected to increase to 90% of GDP by June this year.  The World Bank has projected that the gross public debt would further jump in the next fiscal year to 92% of GDP, according to the Ministry of Economic Affairs.  It added volatility in oil prices and difficulty in rolling over bilateral debt from non-traditional donors (China, Saudi Arabia and the UAE) would compound Pakistan’s external risks and contribute to higher financing gaps.   Transfer, postings   The FBR on Thursday issued transfer and posting orders for about 53 officers of the Inland Revenue Service and Customs Group.  The government has posted Nadeem Rizvi as the new Member Inland Revenue Operations – the key post after the chairperson. His predecessor Seema Shakil has not been given any new posting.  Shakil’s new designation is Member FBR stationed in Karachi, but the FBR headquarters is in Islamabad.  Faiz Illahi Memon, who was serving as Chief Commissioner LTU Karachi, has been appointed as new Member Administration FBR.  Bakhtiar Muhammad has been appointed new Member Facilitation and Taxpayers Education. Mohammad Qasim Samad is new Member Taxpayers Audit and Ambreen Iftikhar has been appointed as Member Human Resource Management.  Dr Aftab Imam has been posted as Chief Commissioner RTO Quetta and Ashfaq Ahmad Tunio has been posted as Chief Commissioner LTU Lahore.  Abdul Hameed Memon has been posted as Chief Commissioner LTU Karachi-II and Badruddin Ahmad has been posted as Chief Commissioner LTU Karachi.  The government has also transferred about 36 officers of Pakistan Customs. It has appointed Sarfraz Warraich as new Member Customs Operations.  Zahid Khokhar has been posted as Director General Transit Trade Karachi. Khokhar was earlier serving as Director General Customs Intelligence and Investigation.  Abdul Rashid Shaikh has been appointed as new DG Intelligence and Investigation Customs.   Published in The Express Tribune, May 1 st , 2020.	News
"B.C. to set its own COVID-19 workplace safety rules after outbreaks  01 May 2020, 02:04 by Justine Hunter    A pedestrian bikes past United Poultry in Vancouver's downtown eastside, on April 23, 2020. JONATHAN HAYWARD/The Canadian Press   British Columbia will impose its own safety plans in the workplace after a COVID-19 outbreak at two federally regulated chicken processing plants in Metro Vancouver showed Ottawa failed to protect those workers, provincial health officials say.  Bonnie Henry, B.C.'s Provincial Health Officer, said on Thursday the outbreak demonstrates the need for provincial guidance on pandemic safety plans, which the Canadian Food Inspection Agency was supposed to have ensured were in place.  The investigation began with a single case of COVID-19, which is caused by the novel coronavirus, at United Poultry Co. Ltd. in East Vancouver, and spread to a sister plant, Superior Poultry Processors Ltd. in Coquitlam. Health officials believe some people were travelling between both facilities, and the two plants account for a total of 92 cases since the first one was identified on April 19. The cases include both poultry plant workers and federal inspectors.  The Vancouver Coastal Health authority is responsible for tracing all potential contacts of the people at the two plants who got COVID-19. In a briefing this week, Patricia Daly, Chief Medical Health Officer for VCH, said her investigators went into United Poultry after the first worker tested positive.  “Our staff inspected that plant the next day, and it became obvious that plant, which is under the inspection of the Canadian Food Inspection Agency (CFIA), did not have a robust plan,"" she said.  ""All federally inspected processing plants are required to have a plan to reduce the risk of COVID-19, but their plan was not adequate and wasn’t being executed adequately, and we identified that there were many ill staff working at that processing plant when we attended. We tested all the staff and we ordered the plant closed that day under a public-health order and it remains closed.”  CFIA inspectors are often responsible for inspecting multiple poultry plants.  Fabian Murphy, president of the Agriculture Union, which represents more than 4,000 CFIA employees, said his organization has been pushing Ottawa to limit the number of plants an inspector is required to visit to reduce the risk of contracting COVID-19.  CFIA could not be reached for comment.  Dr. Henry told reporters that B.C. and Ottawa share responsibility for safety in those poultry plants – for food safety and for worker safety. “We would expect that they go hand in hand. But sometimes, people who are responsible for the food safety part may not recognize some of the key things that happened on the worker safety side of things,” she said.  “In this case, we clearly needed to do more work on making sure that these plans for worker safety were more robust and were enacted in a more robust way. And that is what we are doing now, as part of our going forward in our new normal. When we start looking at other workplaces ... we are going to have provincial-level guidance, best-practice standards.”  Those standards will ensure worker safety during the pandemic as B.C. begins to lift restrictions that were imposed to curb the spread of the virus, she said.  Earlier this week, B.C. Premier John Horgan rebuked workers in the poultry plants – including the federal inspectors who were found by provincial health officials to be working while sick.  “What we discovered with the poultry facilities, for example, is that the majority of the cases that were connected to that one site were people that were still working, including the federal inspectors. That just can’t continue,"" the Premier said during a news conference.  On Thursday, B.C. Health Minister Adrian Dix said the outbreak should serve as a broad warning, as B.C. prepares to begin reopening the economy. “What’s happened in the poultry industry in Vancouver and in Coquitlam is a warning to us about why we need to continue to be vigilant.”  Officials from United Poultry could not be reached for comment. On the company’s website, it says extensive monitoring of the workplace is part of the routine. “To ensure that every process is followed diligently, meticulously and correctly, we have doctors and inspectors on our staff who are on site at all times.”   With reports from Mike Hager and Andrea Woo in Vancouver    We have a weekly Western Canada newsletter written by our B.C. and Alberta bureau chiefs, providing a comprehensive package of the news you need to know about the region and its place in the issues facing Canada.

"Labor floats active cyber defence and a civilian cyber corps for Australia | ZDNet  01 May 2020, 02:36 by Stilgherrian   Labor proposes a public health approach, to cybersecurity, addressing the risk and susceptibility of the whole nation to cyber attack, not just critical infrastructure or 'big-ticket capabilities'.     Shadow Assistant Communications Minister and Shadow Assistant Cyber Security Minister Tim Watts Screenshot: Stilgherrian   A UK-style national Active Cyber Defence program (ACD) and a volunteer-driven Civilian Cyber Corps (C3) are two key components of a cyber resilience program being discussed by the Australian Labor Party. ""It's not just about critical infrastructure or government departments, although that's obviously a very big and important part of our cyber resilience,"" said Shadow Minister for Home Affairs, Immigration and Citizenship, Senator Kristina Keneally. ""As COVID-19 has shown, we need to think about how we protect small businesses, and the people who form the basis of our community and our economy."" Australia needs to push beyond the traditional defence and national security paradigm for cybersecurity, Keneally said, and start adopting a more ""public health approach"". ""When I say public health approach, I mean an approach that looks at the risk and the susceptibility of the nation as a whole rather than principally focusing on critical infrastructure or big-ticket capabilities, an approach that lifts the baseline cybersecurity capability throughout the nation.""  On Friday Labor released a policy discussion paper titled National Cyber Resilience: Is Australia Prepared for a Computer Covid-19? . It builds on last month's comments from the party's Shadow Assistant Communications Minister and Shadow Assistant Cyber Security Minister, Tim Watts, who had wondered how Australia would cope with a cyber-corona outbreak .  Watts was referring to a scenario where thousands of organisations fall victim, disrupting supply chains with similar effects to the coronavirus pandemic currently sweeping the planet.  Hoping to emulate the UK's active cyber defence 'big wins'  ""Active cyber defence could be a good initiative for improving the collective security of the Australian internet,"" Watts said in a roundtable hosted by the Australian Strategic Policy Institute International Cyber Policy Centre. ""The [ACD] framework is designed, in the words of the NCSC [National Cyber Security Centre, part of the Government Communications Headquarters], to take away most of the harm from most of the people most of the time."" ACD has been at the centre of the UK govrenment's cyber defences since 2016. It aims to raise the cost and risk of mounting commodity cyber attacks in the UK, and reducing return on investment for those criminals. One of the NCSC's earliest ACD projects was to deploy the Domain Message Authentication Reporting and Conformance protocol ( DMARC ) across the .gov.uk domains to help eliminate spam and other email spoofing attacks. NCSC began monitoring internet routing to stop DDoS attacks and route hijacks in 2018, and since then has had some big wins . They've even proposed building an automated national cyber defence system . ""Simple things done at scale can have a difference,"" said NCSC technical director Dr Ian Levy in 2018. ""My job is not to beat cybercrime. It's to send it to France."" Last month the NCSC took down 2,000 coronavirus scammers as part of a major phishing campaign. Watts says that the current state of Australia's cyber resilience is ""very varied"". The Australian Signals Directorate (ASD) and the big banks are ""great, they're well placed"", but ASX 50 companies are ""a bit more mixed"". ""When you look at Commonwealth entities, they're a decidedly mixed bag. We've got a very substantial body of evidence from the Australian National Audit Office there,"" Watts said. ""And then when you look at small business, they're really not able to protect themselves from commodity cyber attacks, let alone anything more sophisticated.""  From cyber posse to cyber civil corps  Watts is ""personally attracted"" to the potential of some sort of civilian cyber defence organisation. ""It's a volunteer-driven organisation with a professional framework that allows part time [or] retired volunteer people with cybersecurity skills to leverage up their expertise and build capacity through their organisations,"" he said. ""Whatever we're doing in this post-COVID-19 space in national cyber resilience, our view is that it needs to work fundamentally through the broader community."" The C3 concept is not dissimilar to the Rural Fire Service (RFS) or State Emergency Service (SES) organisations that already exist in Australia at the state level. It's also a concept that has some history. Back in 2012, critical infrastructure security expert Emeritus Professor Bill Caelli suggested forming a cyber posse when needed. Under common law, Caelli argued, police or other authorities could simply enlist any technically adept citizens and form a posse to deal with the bad guys. In 2016, Professor Greg Austin, then at the Australian Centre for Cyber Security (ACCS) at the Australian Defence Force Academy (ADFA) in Canberra, proposed an Australian Cyber Civil Corps . The corps would consist of organised volunteer ""rapid response teams"" to deal with ""extreme cyber emergencies"" in the civil sector. ""Extreme cyber emergencies in the civil sector in cyber space are of such low probability that a full-time standing response force cannot be justified, even if Australia could afford it,"" Austin wrote. Austin sharpened his call for such an organisation in 2019. The Research Group on Cyber War and Peace at the University of New South Wales Canberra Australian Defence Force Academy, which he led, noted that Australia was ""not adequately prepared"" for a so-called ""cyber storm"", or multi-vector, multi-wave destructive cyber attack against the country's infrastructure. ""The benefit of the SES model is that it brings together disciplined structures of command authority through a relevant Minister, the commissioner, zone commanders, local commanders and unit commanders,"" the research group wrote. ""The current practice of appointing retired military commanders to commissioner roles in some states also provides a useful pointer for cyber civil defence policy. In the current New South Wales SES Act, state police are subordinated to the SES Commissioner in the event of emergency."" Watts sees a preventative role for 3C organisations, including community outreach and education. ""New America Foundation, the US think tank, has published a piece where they articulate a model where groups like this could actually do testing, assessments, and exercises with local not-for-profits, with small businesses,"" he said. ""Once you build that capability throughout the society, you also have this potential for an on-call expertise resource ... if there is a large scale cyber incident."" Labor stressed that the discussion paper is not a commitment to policy positions. ""We want to put forward some ideas to explore as we seek to develop our policies,"" Keneally said. ""We want to ensure that we are thoroughly investigating as a party, as an opposition, as a party of government, and with key stakeholders, what the Australian government should be looking at now, and how we should be prepared for cyber threats in the future.""

"Normal service resumes on inter-provincial bus routes - VnExpress International  01 May 2020, 02:21 by VnExpress  Transport companies can operate 100 percent of their buses from Wednesday, double the figure regulated one day earlier, according to a Ministry of Transport announcement.  Bus stations are required to ensure passengers sit one seat or one meter apart. Buses with beds can only carry a maximum of 30 passengers, including the driver.  Most buses had only 10-15 passengers on Wednesday despite the fact a long weekend comprising Reunification Day (April 30) and Labor Day (May 1) was approaching, with station managers explaining that people are still afraid of the coronavirus, and so only travel if it is really necessary.  The transport ministry on Tuesday approved the Civil Aviation Administration of Vietnam's (CAAV) proposal to increase the number of domestic flights to meet recovering demand.  From May 1 to 15 the frequency on the Hanoi - HCMC sector could be increased to 36 flights a day either way, and to 52 after that, it said.  It permitted 12 daily fights from Hanoi and HCMC to Da Nang initially, increasing subsequently to 20.  Hanoi and HCMC last Thursday ended their 22-day social distancing campaign, though keeping in place restrictions on public gatherings and many ""non-essential"" businesses like bars and karaoke parlors closed.  Friday marked the country's seventh day without a new Covid-19 infection and the 15th day without community transmission.  The pandemic has spread to 210 countries and territories so far, claiming over 233,700 lives."	News
Covid-19: What you need to know today  Most people also said they’d like to think that India has dodged the bullet — that things won’t get as bad here as they did in Italy, the US, and the UK — but that they are not sure.  01 May 2020, 20:59 by R Sukumar  How much time have you lost because of Covid-19? Your company, if you work in one? Your business, if you own one?  How much time has the economy lost on account of Covid-19 ? The country?  Hint: the answer to none of these questions is 54 days.  That — 54 days — is, of course, the duration of the lockdown till May 17 (it was supposed to end on May 3 but the home ministry on Friday extended the lockdown by two more weeks, although the expanded range of activities allowed in this period suggests that this is more a gradual and graded exit from the lockdown rather than a hard extension) . The ministry of health’s latest zoning document — the country is divided into red, orange and green zones — shows that around a third of the country’s population (according to the last census) lives in the so-called red zones, the most affected by the pandemic -- and even in these, there has been a significant relaxation of lockdown restrictions. An analysis by Hindustan Times shows that 14 of the country’s 15 most densely-populated districts, including all of Delhi, parts of Mumbai, and Chennai, Kolkata, Hyderabad, and Chandigarh are in the red zone.    Coronavirus outbreak: Full coverage    Some of the smart people I have spoken to — one of the benefits of being a journalist is that you have access to a lot of smart people, without being smart yourself — say the question on lost time can’t be answered now simply because there is as yet, no cure for Covid-19, no vaccine, and no telling how much worse things could get.  The general consensus is that if the doubling rate — the number of days it takes for the number of infections to double; this is currently at 11.5 days in India — stays the same, and the central government as well as the state governments, and local administrations follow the home ministry’s guidelines and allow what is allowed (without making a fuss about it), then, things should start returning to normal by the end of May, perhaps June. Except, everyone admits, it will be a new normal.  The infection will flare up, from time to time, and, hopefully, in specific areas, necessitating their containment but people will get used to the new normal of wearing masks, perhaps even gloves, social distancing, restricted travel, working from home, and the almost ritualistic cleansing that has to follow any excursion.  Most people also said they’d like to think that India has dodged the bullet — that things won’t get as bad here as they did in Italy, the US, and the UK — but that they are not sure.  So, assuming that this is indeed the scenario that plays out, let us return to the question about time.  For even businesses that will bounce back almost immediately after the crisis — essentials and consumables, for instance — this financial year, 2020-21, will effectively be only nine months long.  For many others, it will be even shorter. And the expectation, even among IT services companies, which get most of their revenue from servicing businesses in other parts of the world is that however long the year is, it will also be a very bad year.  In temporal terms, that means that a company can consider itself fortunate if it ends 2021-22 (next financial year) where it would have ended 2019-20 (the last financial year), provided the last month had not been locked out because of Covid-19.  In simple terms, that means a loss of two years.  Personal finances, for those who have investment portfolios, could take just as long to recover, maybe longer, except for survivalists who invest in gold and nothing else.  But this is at the level of large businesses and the salaried working class, although many of the former will now focus sharply on reducing costs and at least some of the latter will lose their jobs.  Many small businesses will go under, years of hard work wiped out by one Black Swan event. And many people who stopped being poor — India’s big achievement in the years between 2006 and 2016 was to lift 271 million people out of poverty, according to a United Nations report — will slip back into poverty. We have no idea how many yet.  An April working paper by the United Nations spoke of poverty “levels similar to those recorded 30 years ago” in some countries, and the possibility of the overall number of poor people in the world increasing by 420-580 million.  It will be a new world post-Covid	NotNews

WWE And AEW Could Allow Fans To Attend Florida Events Sometime This Month   01 May 2020, 20:17    May 1, 2020   WWE And AEW Could Allow Fans To Attend Florida Events Sometime This Month   Danny Cox   After nearly two months without having any fans in attendance, both WWE and All Elite Wrestling may be able to change that this month. Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis is allowing some small businesses to open with restrictions, and he has made it clear that things are happening in phases, and in a safe manner. If all continues down the right path, the superstars and wrestlers could have an audience within the next few weeks.  The Re-Open Florida Task Force, organized by DeSantis, has set forth a three-phase plan to have things return to normal in the state. This plan goes along with the requirements that President Donald Trump suggested for all states last week amid the coronavirus pandemic.  According to Wrestling Inc. , each phase has different stipulations for which businesses can resume operations and at which capacity.  Phase 1 states that people still can’t gather in groups larger than 10 in a small location. The guidelines and stipulations read in such a way that it could allow for fans to return to arenas where professional wrestling events are taking place.  DeSantis states that any large sporting event should continue to use strict social distancing guidelines. In addition to social distancing, occupancy for the event should be limited to no more than 25 percent of the building’s capacity.  Phase 2 would allow for a higher capacity, as would Phase 3 before returning to regular attendance.    WWE   All WWE events have taken place at the Performance Center in Orlando, Florida, for the last six weeks. That includes WrestleMania 36 , which took place over two nights with no fans in attendance. WWE has pre-taped enough footage without having to return to film until May 11.  AEW can hold events at Daily’s Place in Jacksonville, Florida, and it can hold 5,500 fans when allowed. The company has been filming without any fans in attendance as well, and they have enough footage to air shows through the middle of May.  Florida has not offered many of the details for Phase 2 and Phase 3, as they need to have a “successful conclusion” of Phase 1 first. Upon getting through that first phase without having an increase in the number of coronavirus cases, the state will be able to move ahead.  Neither WWE nor AEW have commented on if they will allow fans to attend events during the first phase or two of Florida’s reopening plan. Some superstars are still choosing not to attend tapings, even with minimal staff in attendance, as they don’t feel it is safe yet.	News

New satellite images show aftermath of Israeli strikes in Syria: photos  01 May 2020, 18:28 by News Desk  Private intelligence firm ImageSat has released a series of satellite images allegedly showing the extent of the damage done to Syrian infrastructure by the airstrikes that targeted the country between 31 March and 27 April. One set of images purportedly showed the destruction at the Shayrat Air Base, in the Homs region as a result of the 31 March airstrike.  According to the images, the air raid destroyed navigation equipment and left craters at the airbase, but all of that has since been repaired, with the base resuming operations two weeks after the strike, the company claimed.     Another set of images reportedly showed the destruction from the airstrikes near the city of Al-Sukhah, east of Homs, Syria. The airstrike allegedly levelled half of a warehouse on the road to Palmyra. ImageSat alleged that the building was used to store missiles or other advanced weapons, but didn’t indicate the source of such information.     The intelligence firm also released satellite images allegedly depicting the consequences of the air raid on the Al Mazzeh military airport located near Damascus on 27 April. The photos show a crater appearing at the alleged entrance to the underground part of the facility, comparing it to images from November 2019, when the airbase was attacked last time.     All of these attacks have been attributed to Israel by Syrian media outlets, but Tel Aviv has refused to either deny or confirm being behind them. In the past Israel acknowledged responsibility for some such strikes claiming to have targeted Iran or its proxies purportedly stationed in Syria – something that both Damascus and Tehran deny.  However, in light of the recent attacks, Defence Minister Naftali Bennett might have hinted in a veiled form that Tel Aviv was behind the April strikes saying that Israel has “moved from blocking Iran’s entrenchment in Syria to forcing it out of there”.  “We will not allow more strategic threats to grow just across our borders without taking action. We will continue to take the fight to the enemy’s territory”, Bennett said.  Source: Sputnik	NotNews
French Police Charge Suspect Who Injured Two Officers in Car-Ramming Incident, Reports Says   01 May 2020, 18:28    MOSCOW (Sputnik) - French police have charged a man who hit three officers in a car-ramming incident in suburban Paris, injuring two of them, the French newspaper L’Obs reported on Friday, citing anti-terror prosecutors.   According to the newspaper, the individual is charged with the attempted murder with terrorist intent of figures of public authority.  The incident took place in Colombes, a suburb of the French capital, on Monday. The 29-year-old man was arrested at the scene, and prosecutors allege that a letter bearing an oath of allegiance to Daesh* was found in his vehicle.  France has been hit by a wave of terrorist attacks in recent years, including the attacks of November 2015 in the capital that resulted in the deaths of 130 people. Seven months later, an Islamist militant drove a truck into a crowd of people in the southern city of Nice, killing 86 people.   *Daesh (also known as ISIS, IS, ISIL) is a terrorist group banned in Russia.

The British Beer & Pub Association (BBPA) said pubs were the first sector to be hit by the Covid-19 crisis after they were ordered to close by the Government.  The fall in pub sales shows the “cliff-edge impact” of the Prime Minister’s advice to avoid pubs, followed by the order for them to close, said the trade body.  It welcomed Government financial support to help pubs, but it warned there were “significant gaps” that needed to be filled.    A woman walks past a boarded up pub in north London (Dominic Lipinski/PA)   Emma McClarkin, chief executive of the BBPA said: “These stark figures reveal how the lockdown is having a devastating impact on our pubs.  “The cliff-edge impact on our sector in March, when people were told to stop going to the pub and then pubs were shutdown, is clear to see.  “In April, beer sales for pubs will be zero.    Home made banners in support of the NHS and key workers are hung outside The Dragonfly pub in Basingstoke (Andrew Matthews/PA)   “Local pubs are the heart of our communities.  “They are vital socially, culturally and economically.  “Without further support, particularly for the 10,000 pubs who aren’t getting any grants, many pubs across the UK are in real jeopardy of being lost forever.  “When this crisis is over, the first place many will want to visit with their friends, family and neighbours is their local pub.  “The Government must invest in them now to save them for the future.”	News
"Why COVIDSafe Has Issues On iOS, As Explained By Devs  01 May 2020, 11:45 by Tegan Jones    Image: Getty Images   One of the biggest question marks around the government's COVIDSafe app has been around iOS functionality - how it works, if it works, when it will be updated, etc. There's a lot of confusion around using the app on an iPhone, which is a problem when almost 54 per cent of the mobile-using population uses iOS . But now things might be a little clearer.  During a COVIDSafe teardown and panel discussion earlier this week , some experts in field explained the difference between the Android and iOS implementations of COVIDSafe, and why iOS devices can't run it as effectively in the background.  If you're interested in watching the entire COVIDsafe teardown discussion, we have included the video at the bottom of this article.  How COVIDSafe Works On Android  During the panel Matthew Robbins (Mobile development expert, creator of MFractor) first explained how COVIDSafe runs on Android, saying it's ""perfectly fine"" due to having a 'service', which runs in the background.  ""If you think of an app like a car you have the exterior of it that you can see, which is the user interface, then you have the engine which you know is running... but you can't see it,"" said Robbins.  ""A service is like an engine, it's always running under the hood doing the scanning and the advertising [of the bluetooth signal].""  Robbins explained that Android has a start up receiver that tells apps when the phone has been turned on. This triggers apps to do certain things. In the case of COVIDSafe, it starts doing the background service that will search for the app's bluetooth signal in other devices.  ""Android simply doesn't have the same concerns [as iOS],"" said Robbins.     How COVIDSafe Works On iOS  iOS doesn't work in the same way as Android, which is why it may have issues effectively advertising COVIDSafe's bluetooth signal.  ""In general iOS does a pretty good job of detecting the other phones but the issue is the rate at which it broadcasts the advert of its presence,"" said Alec Tucker (Mobile Architect & Consultant, co-founder of Obiquitech).  This happens quite consistently when the app is in the foreground, which is what the government has recommended people do. But problems can arise when another app comes into the foreground or if the phone is locked.  ""All being well it will carry on advertising but that app then drops down in the priority of the access it has to the phone's bluetooth resources,"" said Tucker.  ""If another app comes to the foreground that requests access to the bluetooth resources the COVIDSafe app will come second in that argument.""  Tucker also stated that some iOS services that can take priority as well.  It's worth mentioning that the app can still run and send out a bluetooth signal if it's not in the foreground, but it can be impacted by the above factors.  ""They can cause those frequencies to decrease or to stop altogether.""  Devs who have been tearing down the COVIDsafe app are currently diving even deeper into the iOS code with the help of Joel Kek, an engineer who worked on Singapore's contact tracing app TraceTogether, which COVIDSafe is based on.  The Future Of COVIDSafe On iOS  While the government previously stated it would not be working with Apple and Google (who are working on an API level solution), this narrative changed when the shortcomings with the iOS implementation of the app became known.  ""We know that Apple, around the world, is working on that and we will provide those upgrades and updates as well,"" said health minister Greg Hunt in a briefing .  A spokesperson for the Minister of Government Services Stuart Robert also confirmed this .  ""The Government will work with Google and Apple to investigate whether the new functionality announced by Google and Apple partnership is beneficial for the app performance,"" they said in a statement.  The latest iOS 13.5 beta also includes features related to COVID-19 tracing. The inclusion of this in the Software Developer Kit (SDK) and API will allow devs to create apps to help with contacting tracing.  There is also a setting inclusion in the beta that allows users to opt out of receiving COVID-19 exposure notifications, if they had an app installed that allowed for that.  There is no hard timeline on when any updates or fixes for iOS functionality will be implemented, but there has been talk that it will hopefully be in the coming weeks."	NotNews
"3 Dividend Kings to Buy and Hold Forever  These stocks are perfect for retirement income because the companes have reliable track records of dividend payouts.  01 May 2020, 11:15 by Will Ebiefung (TMFwillebbs)  Stocks can be unpredictable, so it's nice when an investment in your portfolio generates a cash payout every quarter and helps satisfy the need for some consistent income. That's part of what makes dividend stocks a great way for long-term investors to get reliable returns, even in uncertain times.  And what better way to get a consistent payout than investing in a stock which has been labeled a Dividend King ? Dividend Kings are a very select group of 27 S&P 500 companies that have increased their yearly dividend payout for at least 50 straight years. That consistency in rewarding shareholders suggests these companies have a business model that holds up well in the good times as well as the bad.  Let's take a closer look at three of these Dividend Kings and learn a bit more about how they earned this distinction. The first pick, Johnson & Johnson ( NYSE:JNJ ), is a recession-resistant investment in the global healthcare sector. The other two, Hormel Foods ( NYSE:HRL ) and Target ( NYSE:TGT ), are defensive consumer goods companies that can thrive in any economic environment. All three are Dividend Kings worth buying and holding forever.    Image source: Getty Images.   1. Johnson & Johnson: 57 years of increasing dividends  Johnson & Johnson is a diversified manufacturer of healthcare products. It operates in both the biotech and consumer sides of the industry where it develops everything from new pharmaceutical drugs to over-the-counter skin, health, and hair care products. The global healthcare market has grown at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 7.3% since 2014. It is expected to grow at an 8.9% CAGR until 2022 even when factoring in the potential negative effects of the coronavirus pandemic.  Healthcare is considered a defensive sector because consumers are still likely to spend money on it even during difficult economic times. That's part of the reason why Johnson & Johnson holds up well in recessions and has managed to grow its dividend for 57 years running.  Johnson & Johnson offers a 2.61% dividend yield with a 52.29% payout ratio , meaning it has plenty of free cash flow to maintain its dividend payouts. The company also has a robust stock buyback program that saw management repurchase $5 billion worth of common stock in 2019. While controversial, buybacks help mature companies like Johnson & Johnson grow earnings per share, keep their payout ratios low, and their stock prices stable. The stock has grown 2.12% year to date compared to a 10.23% decline in the S&P 500.  2. Target: 52 years of increasing dividends  Target operates retail stores and supermarkets in the U.S. along with a small, rapidly growing e-commerce platform. The U.S grocery sector is a mature, but reliable, source of revenue that has enabled Target to steadily maintain its dividend every year since 1967. The company's rapidly growing e-commerce platform looks set to power the next half-century of dividend growth.  Target is a cash cow generating $77.1 billion in revenue in 2019. But while the company's top line is relatively slow-growing, it's e-commerce platform is accelerating. Digital sales grew 29% in 2019. And the coronavirus pandemic boosted digital sales by 275% in early April.  Target sports a 2.36% dividend yield with a payout ratio of 40%. Like other names on this list, management helps ensure dividend sustainability through a massive share repurchase program. The buyback has $5 billion worth of shares eligible for repurchase this year. And it should help boost Target's EPS and keep the company's dividend costs in check until its e-commerce revenue trickles down to the bottom line.  3. Hormel Foods: 54 years of increasing dividends  Nothing screams ""hold me forever"" quite like Hormel Foods. Founded in 1928, this dividend king makes its money manufacturing and marketing meat products around the world. Americans love meat. And with millions of people entering the global middle class every year, global protein consumption is set to surge for the foreseeable future.  Hormel is a defensive stock because people have to eat, even in bad economic times. The company generated 52% of its 2019 sales from U.S retail and 31% from food service. The remaining 17% comes from U.S. deli meat and international operations.  Hormel's foodservice business may face challenges from the coronavirus pandemic which has shut down the U.S restaurant industry. But the company reaffirmed 2020 guidance as recently as February 2020.  Hormel offers a dividend yield of 1.95% which looks low compared to other names on this list (but is about average when it comes to dividend-yielding stocks). The company offers an unparalleled total return. Hormel's stock has soared 463.3% over the last decade compared to 153.5% for Target and 209.8% for Johnson & Johnson. For comparison, the S&P 500's return over the same period was 144.4%.  These are dividend kings to buy and hold forever."	NotNews
Drive-By Truckers – “Quarantine Together”  01 May 2020, 11:37 by Ryan Leas  Earlier this year, the long-running institution Drive-By Truckers returned with their latest album, The Unraveling . With much of their work typically being conceptual in nature, it was an album that was born from the tumultuous political times of recent years. And that was, you know, before everything else that’s happened this year. Drive-By Truckers were supposed to be on the road touring behind The Unraveling , but naturally that is not the case. So now they’ve joined the host of artists trying to make the best of the situation, and have given us a rather timely new song.  It’s called “Quarantine Together.” Patterson Hood wrote it during the first week of all this, and it has plenty of lyrical references to our current situation. “We might as well quarantine together/ Because we’d be miserable all alone,” Hood sings. But rather than a kind of coronavirus-era PSA, it seems like a tongue-in-cheek would-be relationship song, with Hood adding thoughts like: “So if you come on over to my place/ I promise you I will stay/ Six feet away.” Musically, it’s got a lived-in, easygoing ramble that fits right into the Truckers’ wheelhouse.  “Quarantine Together” is one of many special releases tied to Bandcamp waiving its revenue shares again today; DBT are offering a couple things through their own page there to try to support the band and crew during this. The song also comes with a homemade video featuring the different members of the band solo at their houses, playing the song. And much like your Zoom calls for work, children and pets make some cameos. Check it out below.     In addition, Hood announced that he and Mike Cooley would both be doing some livestream performances. Hood’s is on Wednesday 5/6 at 6PM PT/9PM ET, and Cooley’s is on Friday 5/8 at 5PM PT/8PM ET. Tickets for each are available here and here .	News
RBNZ: Further QE remains on the table – UOB  01 May 2020, 11:37 by Pablo Piovano  According to strategists at UOB Group’s Quarterly Global Outlook, the likeliness of another round of QE by the RBNZ should not be ruled out just yet.  Key Quotes  “Encouragingly, the RBNZ has been quick to react in the current environment. On 23 March, policymakers announced that it would conduct large-scale asset purchases of New Zealand government bonds (NZGBs) “to provide further support to the economy, build confidence, and keep interest rates on government bonds low”. The RBNZ will purchase NZD30bn worth of NZGBs across the yield curve in the next 12 months, because “financial conditions have tightened unnecessarily over the past week.” They have also said that they stand ready to “make adjustments and additions if needed.”  “The latest move follows on from the RBNZ’s provision of significant additional liquidity , and freeing up of bank capital (of around NZD47bn by delaying the imposition of tougher bank capital requirements by a year). More importantly, the RBNZ in an emergency and bold move on 16 March – lowered the OCR by 75bps from 1.00% to 0.25%. It gave explicit forward guidance, committing to keep the OCR there for at least 12 months. Our view is that it will remain there even longer.”  “Depending on how the current financial market situation develops, more QE may be required down the road, perhaps buying other assets, or aimed at facilitating lending to certain segments. We strongly believe the RBNZ will be watching this space very closely.”	News
"Gary Neville explains his bizarre plan to complete the Premier League season  The Premier League are meeting on Friday to discuss how they could look to restart the 2019/20 season  01 May 2020, 11:04 by Connor O’Neill , Stuart Jamieson  Gary Neville believes the Premier League should consider taking the Premier League abroad to a coronavirus-free quarantined environment to finish the season.  The Premier League is believed to be determined to finish the current season and is currently exploring the best possible ways to do so.  Although any return to club football in England is entirely dependent on government approval, the latest reports, however, have suggested that senior figures at Downing Street are behind the idea of “Project Restart”.  But Neville believes there are still questions as to whether the UK is safe enough to house competitive football, even behind closed doors and believes playing abroad should be considered.  ""If the Premier League are really serious about delivering the matches that remain in a safe environment they would move it to the two or three spots that are within three or four hours of this country that are coronavirus free,” he told The Football Show on Sky Sports.

Grounded flights threaten routine vaccine supply: UN  01 May 2020, 16:30 by The Independent       Geneva, Switzerland | AFP | Dozens of countries risk running out of vaccines for diseases like measles because of restrictions on flights brought in to tackle the new coronavirus, the United Nations warned on Friday.  The UN children’s agency UNICEF called for support to unlock a massive backlog in vaccine shipments.  It said the delays had been caused by “unprecedented logistical constraints” linked to lockdowns and other measures put in place to halt the spread of COVID-19, which has killed more than 233,000 people and infected nearly 3.3 million in a matter of months.  But UNICEF and other organisations have warned that a drop in routine vaccinations could fuel other, potentially deadlier outbreaks of a range of diseases.  UNICEF said in 2019 it had procured 2.43 billion doses of vaccines for 100 countries, to reach around 45 percent of all children worldwide under the age of five.  But since the week of March 22, the agency has seen a 70-80 percent reduction in planned vaccine shipments because of the sharp decline in commercial flights and limited availability of charter flights, spokeswoman Marixie Mercado told journalists in an online briefing.  “Dozens of countries are at risk of stock-out due to delayed vaccine shipments.”  She warned that 26 countries, mainly in Africa but also several Asian countries like North Korea and Myanmar, were particularly at risk.  The cost of securing space on the few flights available has soared, with freight rates now up to 200 percent above normal prices, she said.  “Countries with limited resources will struggle to pay these higher prices, leaving children vulnerable to vaccine-preventable diseases,” Mercado said, citing polio and measles.  Five of the countries most at risk were hit with outbreaks of measles — a highly contagious, sometimes fatal viral infection, she said.  Mercado warned that even before the pandemic, vaccines for measles, polio and other diseases were out of reach for some 20 million children under the age of one every year.  “Disruptions in routine immunisation, particularly in countries with weak health systems, could lead to disastrous outbreaks in 2020 and well beyond,” she said.

Small Businesses Need Cash Flow Not Cheap Debt  01 May 2020, 16:03 by New Zealand National Party  Cheap loans won’t be enough to save the thousands of businesses that have been starved of revenue for the last six weeks, National’s Economic Development and Small Business spokesperson Todd McClay says.  “Today’s announcement is too little and risks being too late. It’s not targeted enough and all they are doing is taking the debt that’s been accumulated over the past six weeks and moving it sideways.  “What businesses need now is direct cash flow grants not cheap debt so that when we finally leave these heavy lockdown-like conditions, they can get up and running again quickly.  “The loan scheme criteria is also overly restrictive. All businesses should be viewed as viable because they have been forced to close through no fault of their own and with little time to prepare.  “Every business that stays open means more jobs are kept.  “Australia provided instant cash flow grants to businesses across the ditch which has allowed many to keep operating.  “Tourism, hospitality and retail have been shut down for six weeks and they won’t have any certainty about when they can open for another week.  “The longer this goes on, the more businesses will fall over and more jobs will be lost.

"2021 Dodge Durango Will Feature More Than Just A Hellcat V8  But buyers are going to have to be patient.  01 May 2020, 16:41 by Aaron Brzozowski  Not one to let a good engine go to waste, Dodge and SRT are planning yet another Hellcat-powered vehicle for the North American market, and it's one that should make performance-SUV fans happy.  As we reported back in February, the 2021 Dodge Durango lineup will gain a new SRT Hellcat model , propelled by the same bonkers, 707-horsepower supercharged V8 as the Hellcat Challenger and Charger, not to mention the Jeep Grand Cherokee Trackhawk. The new high-output Durango will be a sort of swansong for the current third-generation model line, which is overdue for a replacement.             But fans might have to wait a bit longer than expected for the 2021 Dodge Durango SRT Hellcat to take to the streets; according to Mopar Insiders, the 2021 Durango program has been delayed by some three months due to the global Covid-19 pandemic. While the updated model line was expected to start production this fall, it could be winter 2020 -or perhaps early-2021 - before the 2021 Dodge Durango lineup enters production.  Apart from SRT's bellowing, 707-horsepower 6.2L Hellcat motor, the 2021 Dodge Durango lineup is also set to inherit FCA's ""eTorque"" mild-hybrid system from the likes of the Ram 1500 and Jeep Wrangler. The system will come standard with both the 3.6L Pentastar V6 and 5.7L Hemi V8.                 Mopar Insiders further reports that the 2021 Dodge Durango SRT Hellcat will launch with a special-edition model, with a serialized badge on the dash much like the special-edition Challenger and Charger models. If there's one thing FCA knows how to do well, it's to drum up enthusiasm with limited-run special-edition trim packages.  Performance in the new Hellcat-powered Durango should be similar to that of the Jeep Grand Cherokee Trackhawk , as the former will essentially inherit the latter's AWD powertrain. The Trackhawk dispatches with 60 mph in a scant 3.5 seconds and blasts through the quarter-mile in 11.6. Those are jaw-dropping figures for a big, heavy utility vehicle.

Russia drops plans for Putin mosaic in military church   01 May 2020, 16:33   MOSCOW (Reuters) - A grandiose mosaic depicting Russian President Vladimir Putin and other high-ranking officials will not be put on display in a new military church after objections from the Kremlin leader, a church official said on Friday.  Russia is building a massive cathedral dedicated to its armed forces just west of Moscow. It had been scheduled to open its doors this month to mark 75 years since the Soviet victory in World War Two, but its inauguration is likely to be postponed because of the coronavirus outbreak.  A picture of the mosaic, which shows Putin alongside Defence Minister Sergei Shoigu and other top officials showing their support for Russia’s 2014 annexation of Crimea from Ukraine, was first published by the MBKh news website last week.  Another mosaic panel photographed separately showed a group of women gathered in front of a sign reading “Crimea is ours.”  Speaking to the Interfax news agency on Friday, Bishop Stefan, the cathedral’s archpriest, said its arts committee had decided not to put the mosaic on display in line with the “wish of the head of state.” He did not provide further details.  Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said last week that Putin was aware of the mosaic but that the Russian leader thought it was too early to celebrate the accomplishments of the country’s current leadership.  The Crimean peninsula’s annexation propelled Russia’s relations with the West to a post-Cold War low and saw a string of countries impose economic sanctions on Moscow.

The Nobu Hotel - Robert De Niro's backed a haven in the heart of Shoreditch  The Holllywood star has joined forces yet again with the master chef on this East London hotel blockbuster  01 May 2020, 17:08 by Charlotte Cox, https://www.facebook.com/Charlotte-Cox-covering-Wythenshawe-and-Manchester-Airport-and-Transport-822935881061459/?ref=hl  When you think 'Nobu' - the Japanese restaurant bearing the name of its chef creator Matsuhisa Nobu - it may bring to mind shiny celebrities attending London's swanky Mayfair venue as much to be seen as for the sushi.  So we arrived at the firm's latest venture, a collaboration between Nobu, actor Robert De Niro, film producer Meir Teper and Australian businessman James Packer, wary we might find Hollywood style over city-stay substance.  Nobu Hotel Shoreditch, it turns out, is super stylish - but the night away also left us feeling relaxed, well-fed and happy.  Turning a corner off Great Eastern Street after a 10 minute walk from Old Street station, the hotel rose, perhaps a little incrongruously amid the exposed brick of Shoreditch, like an ultra-modern ship, all concrete, glass and slick balconies.     Through a sliding tinted glass entrance, we were met by rattan screens and a lounge area with a calming grey and red colour-theme, melded with hip London-style concrete, subtle lighting and blinds featuring the work of local artists.  The greeting by reception was under-stated but warm, perfect following a hectic train journey and crammed tube ride.  The peaceful environment continued in the room. We were in a deluxe. Embracing the Japanese tradition of simple but high quality furnishings, there was a very comfortable king-sized bed and the TV was atop a gold-covered cabinet.    One of Nobu's 143 guest rooms   The luxurious gold fittings continued into the bathroom, which featured a walk-in shower and Natura Bisse products. With both a blind and a slatted door at the window, this was a room designed for relaxation.  There are 143 guest rooms in total, as well as seven suites, a meeting space, bar and 240-seat restaurant. Guests have free wifi and 24-hour room service.    An impressive selection of sushi and sashimi   The Food  In the basement, at the end of a grand back-lit staircase, lives the open-plan restaurant and bar where we were welcomed with a glass of Champagne.  This huge space, given natural light by the ceiling-height windows at one end,  is overseen by executive chef Greg Seregith. The menu features many of Nobu's classics as well as new additions.  We had the weekend brunch, with unlimited access to both a savoury and deserts buffet as well as dishes served straight from kitchen.    A back-lit staircase leads to the bar and restaurant   The food on offer is true to Nobu's signature style, which combines Japanese and South American flavours.  In our case, this included a mouth-watering selection of sushi and sashimi.  At the buffet, the chicken karaage was cooked to perfection, the Japanese stew was very tasty - and the salads were a refreshing way to start the meal.  The tiger prawns with Shisho tomato salsa and crispy sweet potato were beautifully cooked, while the jalapeno salmon brought the taste of the sea to Shoreditch.  The braised beef yaki Gyoza was melt-in-the-mouth.    The weekend buffet   The desert selection was both immense in quantity and and beautiful in its presentation.  Lemongrass and kaffir lime creme brulee, green tea tiramisu,  cheesecake with raspberry jelly, panatone bread and butter pudding, fruit and biscotti.  The staff were friendly and accomodating. One waiter did accidentally drop the contents of a plate across our table, but he did so with a charming apology.    The sake-stocked bar where you can enjoy a cocktail   Afterwards, we had tea in the sake-stocked bar area, looking out on to a Japanese garden.  The Spa  Featuring a pilates studio, treatment rooms and a gym, the spa was yet another relaxing and peaceful setting.  I was met by technician Iuliana Simion, who asked about my skin type and favourite scents.  The hotel had booked me in for 'The Cure' facial - chosen from a comprehensive menu of massages, treatments and facials - but Iuliana advised against this and instead directed me to the 'citrus essence' for my skin type.    A treatment room at the Nobu Hotel   Hands down the best facial I've ever had, the massage was on point, the vibe soothing and the results clear to see, and more importantly, feel.  The treatment promised to 'recapture my skin's luminosity and firmness through a relaxing citrus aromatherapy experience' - and it actually did do just that.  This facial will set you back £130 for an hour. Pricey but as a luxury treat, arguably worth it.  By the time we checked out of Nobu, and after just one night away, we truly felt like we'd had a holiday.      Facts   Double rooms from £249, excluding breakfast (hot dishes from £11). Free Wi-Fi.  The brunch we had, which includes Family Style Dishes and unlimited access to Brunch and Dessert Bar Choice of one glass Sauvignon Blanc, Tinto Rioja or Veuve Clicquot was £55 a head.

Georgia reported over 1,000 new coronavirus cases on the same day its governor lifted the stay-at-home order for most residents  01 May 2020, 17:00 by Grace Panetta, Business Insider US    Alexandra Homyak takes a customer’s temperature before she enters Three-13 Salon, Spa and Boutique, during the phased reopening of businesses and restaurants following the relaxing of restrictions due to the coronavirus disease (COVID-19), in Marietta, Georgia, U.S., April 24, 2020. Bita Honarvar/Reuters    The state of Georgia reported over 1,000 new confirmed cases of COVID-19 on Friday, the same day Gov. Brian Kemp lifted the state’s shelter-in-place order for most of its residents.  The Georgia Department of Public Health reported that there a total of 27,023 confirmed cases of COVID-19 as of Thursday, compared to 26,000 confirmed cases the day before, the Atlanta Journal-Constitution reported.  According to guidelines released by the White House coronavirus task force, states are advised to begin re-opening after 14 days of declining positive cases and declining rates of people reporting symptoms.  Visit Business Insider’s homepage for more stories .   The state of Georgia has reported over 1,000 new confirmed cases of COVID-19 on Friday, the same day Gov. Brian Kemp lifted the state’s shelter-in-place order for most of its 10.6 million residents.  The Georgia Department of Public Health reported that there a total of 27,023 confirmed cases of COVID-19 in the state on Thursday, compared to 26,000 confirmed cases the day before, the Atlanta Journal-Constitution reported.  Health officials also reported that there were 33 new deaths on Thursday, bringing the state’s total death toll to 1,140.  According to guidelines released by the White House coronavirus task force, states are advised to begin re-opening after 14 days of declining positive cases and declining rates of people reporting novel coronavirus symptoms.  But Kemp is forging ahead with re-opening Georgia and encouraging business to resume normal operations despite the number of reported cases in the state rising, drawing bipartisan criticism from fellow elected officials.  The state’s stay-at-home expired for most residents on April 30. Kemp is still extending the state’s public health emergency order and requiring the elderly and “medically fragile” to shelter in place through June 12.  He allowed a slew of business establishments including hair and nail salons, bowling alleys, gyms, and massage-therapy centers to reopen on April 24, followed by restaurants and movie theaters this past Monday, but is still encouraging residents to stay at home if possible.  Kemp has said that businesses must follow “minimum basic operations” of safety, including “screening workers for fever and respiratory illness, enhancing workplace sanitation, wearing gloves and masks if appropriate, separating workspaces by at least 6 feet, and teleworking where at all possible, and implementing staggered shifts.”  But given the sheer number of business establishments under the order, it’s unclear how the state plans to enforce those guidelines across the board , especially in places like hair and nail salons that necessarily involve people being within 6 feet and touching each other.  The governor and his top public health officials are also encouraging residents to wear masks in retail stores or other places where they’ll be in close proximity to others.  Kemp argued in a Thursday interview with the Journal-Constitution that loosening restrictions for the non-elderly population makes sense because almost half of the coronavirus deaths in the state are linked to nursing homes and other long-term care facilities.  But public health experts, other Georgia elected officials, and even President Donald Trump have warned that Georgia may be moving too fast to re-open, and could even risk spreading the virus further and undoing the progress the previous restrictions achieved.  The outbreak of the virus in Georgia is also disproportionately affecting the state’s African-American residents. A study from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention published on Wednesday found that a full 83% of COVID-19 patients hospitalized in Georgia during the month of March were black, despite making up only 32% of the state’s population.  “Reopening the state and relaxing social-distancing measures now is irresponsible and could even be deadly,” Atlanta Mayor Keisha Lance Bottoms wrote in a Thursday op-ed in The Atlantic criticizing Kemp’s decision. “Our hospitals may not be stretched to capacity, but that does not mean we should work to fill the vacant beds. I strongly believe that our health-care system is not overwhelmed because we have been socially distancing.”  And while President Donald Trump has encouraged states to return to business as usual as soon as possible, even he criticized Georgia’s rapid re-opening and actively distanced himself from Kemp.  “I (or [Vice President Mike Pence]) never gave Governor Brian Kemp an OK on those few businesses outside of the Guidelines. FAKE NEWS! Spas, beauty salons, tattoo parlors, & barber shops should take a little slower path, but I told the Governor to do what is right for the great people of Georgia (& USA)!,” Trump tweeted on April 24.  Sen. Lindsey Graham, a staunch ally of Trump who represents the neighboring state of South Carolina, also wrote in an April 22 tweet that he worried, “our friends and neighbors in Georgia are going too fast too soon.”	News

Uzbek Dam Bursts, Forcing Evacuation Of Thousands Of Villagers  01 May 2020, 10:48 by RFE/RL's Uzbek Service  A recently built dam in Uzbekistan has burst, sending water rushing toward villages on the floodplain downstream from the Sardoba Reservoir in the eastern region of Sirdaryo.  Authorities say 11,600 villagers were evacuated on May 1 after the dam on the Sirdaryo River developed a breach at about 6 a.m. local time.  Video footage obtained by RFE/RL shows a gap in one section of the 29-meter-high concrete structure and a torrent of water rushing toward the nearby villages.  Uzbek officials told RFE/RL the breach had weakened the structure and they feared it could cause the entire dam to collapse.  Uzbek President Shavkat Mirziyoev visited the site on May 1 after the evacuation of the flooded villages began.  RFE/RL's Uzbek Service reports that construction of the Sardoba Reservoir dam by Uzbek state builders began in 2010 and was completed in 2017.    Sardoba   Uzbekistan also has signed a $23 million contract with China for the construction of a hydroelectric power station at the site of the dam.

How Profit and Incompetence Delayed N95 Masks While People Died at the VA   01 May 2020, 19:11   This post first appeared at ProPublica . ProPublica is a Pulitzer Prize-winning investigative newsroom. Sign up for The Big Story newsletter to receive stories like this one in your inbox .  Before embarking on a 36-hour tour through an underground of contractors and middlemen trying to make a buck on the nation’s desperate need for masks, entrepreneur Robert Stewart Jr. offered an unusual caveat.  “I’m talking with you against the advice of my attorney,” the man in the shiny gray suit, an American Flag button with the word “VETERAN” pinned to his blazer, said as we boarded a private jet Saturday from the executive wing at Dulles International Airport.  It remains a mystery why the CEO of Federal Government Experts LLC let me observe his frantic effort to find 6 million N95 respirators and the ultimate unraveling of his $34.5 million deal to supply them to the Department of Veterans Affairs hospitals, where 20 VA staff have died of COVID-19 while the agency waits for masks.  It’s also unclear why the VA gave Stewart’s fledgling business — which had no experience selling medical equipment, no supply chain expertise and very little credit — an important contract. Or why the VA agreed to pay nearly $5.75 per mask, a 350% markup from the manufacturer’s list price . In the end, after ProPublica asked questions about the deal this week, the VA quickly terminated it and referred the case to its inspector general for investigation.  Stewart maintained he was trying to do a public service and plans to tell investigators how he was taken for a ride by “buccaneers and pirates,” the multiple layers of intermediaries, fixers and lawyers standing between respirator mask producers and front-line workers who are dying without them.  I had first contacted Stewart last Friday after a ProPublica analysis of federal contracting data showed this sizable deal was his company’s first — and had been awarded without the usual bidding meant to weed out companies that can’t deliver.  Stewart wasn’t alone. The coronavirus pandemic had unleashed a bonanza for untested contractors riding a wave of unprecedented demand and scarcity of everything from hand sanitizer to ICU beds. So far, the administration of President Donald Trump has handed out at least $5.1 billion in no-bid contracts to address the pandemic, federal purchasing data shows. The VA, far more than any other agency, appeared to be awarding large contracts to little-known vendors in search of the personal protective equipment that’s pitted local, state and federal agencies against one another.  I wanted to know how a company the 34-year-old Stewart had formed two years earlier had gotten one of the largest no-bid contracts . And, more importantly, could it fulfill it?  There was reason to wonder. A quick Google search showed large portions of the text on FGE’s company website had been lifted verbatim from a 1982 Harvard Business Review article . The company primarily advertised IT consulting and advertised a “block chain” A.I. solution to government procurement, whatever that means. But I found nothing suggesting the company could buy and ship life-saving medical equipment — and fast.  In a phone call, Stewart was defensive about an article on federal contracts in The Wall Street Journal that he believed unfairly painted him as a crook. His mother was so upset she wrote a letter to the editor. “My mom and dad raised me to be a man of integrity,” he said.  That’s when the first inconsistency arose. The Journal quoted Stewart as saying he was at the Port of Los Angeles “looking at a few million masks” and “getting ready to step on a Boeing 737 to bring the masks to the VA.”  He told me, however, that he had been in self-quarantine and hadn’t traveled anywhere since Christmas.  But he said he did have 6 million N95 respirators masks lined up in Los Angeles and would be getting a “proof of life video,” in the form of cellphone footage of scores of boxes with 3M labels, sent from an unidentified sender. The next day, he planned to take a private plane to the VA distribution center outside of Chicago to witness the delivery. I asked to tag along.  So here we were, aboard a whirring Legacy 450 Flexjet replete with leather captains’ chairs, dozens of liquor shooters, snacks and two pilots curious as to why we were stopping in Columbus, Georgia, en route to Chicago. It was a pit stop to pick up Stewart’s parents to bring them along for what was supposed to be a proud moment.  “This is about helping folks, about being able to say to my mom and dad, ‘Thank you,’” he said. “All the work you did, now we are about to help 6 million people — well, 6 million masks.”  “Kind of a Faith Thing”  For a man who said he had spent weeks of sleepless nights in search of masks and learning shipping logistics, Stewart exuded the confidence of a magician about to perform his career-defining trick. But his next act was already falling apart.  We were midair when Stewart revealed that the 6 million masks that were supposedly in LA had slipped from his grasp and been sold to another buyer when he didn’t produce the money fast enough. So, he had no masks.  This was the second time Stewart said he had lost a mask supply before he could get his hands on it. He had tried earlier in April to procure masks from China, but that failed when the Chinese government took control of its mask-producing companies and limited exports.  I asked why on earth we were flying to Chicago to try to meet the VA’s midnight delivery deadline if he didn’t already have the N95s.  “It was kind of a faith thing,” he said.  For 24 hours, Stewart had frantically reached out to contacts he had made as a former contract officer for the Pentagon. And early Friday, just one day before his shipment was due to the VA, Stewart said he got connected to a fixer in the U.S.  The fixer was Troy King, a former attorney general of Alabama who had just lost a run for Congress in that state’s 2nd District. Stewart said King connected him to an unidentified distributor, who could then connect him with 3M, the manufacturer of N95s, which block 95% of small particles such as those carrying COVID-19. Stewart said King also promised to arrange financing so FGE could get the deal done fast.  “When you’re a poor kid from Alabama,” Stewart said, “you do what you need to do to get the job done.”  Much of what Stewart told me either proved false or impossible to confirm, which he says is because he was being lied to by brokers and middlemen. For instance, he claimed to have a contact within the White House Coronavirus Task Force, led by Vice President Mike Pence, who was working to help him smooth the deal over with VA Secretary Robert Wilkie. But when I asked spokespeople with the task force and the VA about the name he cited, no one had ever heard of her or had employment records for someone by that name.  Stewart said King was the one who claimed to have Pence task force connections and was brokering the deal through an Alabama LLC, Bear Mountain Development Company. King would charge a broker’s fee for connecting FGE to the distributor, Stewart said, and the payout would depend on shipment volume. But the price per mask kept changing. King told Stewart it would cost him $4.90 per mask — without shipping or overhead — to get the supplies from the distributor, according to text messages Stewart shared.  King did not respond to my calls or emails, but through a spokeswoman said he talked to Stewart because he was having trouble getting masks.  “I worked all weekend to locate 3M masks that were available. The only 3M masks we could source for him were priced at $4.90 per mask, which is the price that we were being charged by our supplier.”  King said no cash changed hands and that he thought he might forgo the broker fee.  “Due to the fact that these products were for use in veterans’ facilities, we agreed that our efforts might end up being an uncompensated public service,” the statement said.  The deal’s tenuous nature — a broker Stewart didn’t know, buying from a seller he didn’t know, financed by someone he didn’t know — seemed a profound and expensive leap of faith. But Stewart was convinced that he was “getting the VA a good thing at a good price.”  He had been called to action, he said, after seeing a CNN segment where a nurse described making her own face shield out of plastic film. As a former Air Force officer, he said he felt compelled to help.  “The goal here is not to get rich,” he said. FGE would be lucky to pocket about 10 cents a mask, he said, somewhere around $600,000, when the VA got its goods.  Yet we were bobbing around on a lavish jet, when commercial flights were available at about one one-hundredth of the cost per ticket.  When I asked why he spent more than $22,000 on a private plane, he said it was to prove he was no fly-by-nighter but a reputable government contractor.  “It comes down to me and my credibility,” he said. “Why would anybody pay $22,000 to have a ghost box delivery? It doesn’t make any sense.”  This was money out of FGE’s pocket. The government typically doesn’t pay vendors like Stewart until the goods are delivered. (ProPublica reimbursed FGE for the cost of a commercial ticket.)  Stewart pulled a faded Bible from his bag and talked about miracles. His chance to prove himself on this deal, he said, is a small miracle.  “Awarding a $34.5 million contract to a small company without any supply chain experience,” he mused. “Why would you do that?”  Price Gouging?  Why the VA would do that is a lingering question. While the Federal Emergency Management Agency is officially leading the effort to scrounge up PPE, reportedly plucking shipments out from under states and other parts of the executive branch, the VA made its own supply purchases in March and April.  But despite signing 1,100 contracts worth $591 million just for PPE, the VA has experienced a devastating shortage for weeks. Nurses and doctors are reusing masks, avoiding patients and rationing gear. As BuzzFeed News reported April 7, despite the VA’s public assurances that the supply chain was “kicked into full gear,” leaders at one hospital said nurses and doctors were allowed only one surgical mask per shift. The more effective N95 masks, which the VA hired Stewart and his company to hunt down three days later, were in such short supply that they could only be used if there was a high chance of aerosolization, meaning the virus was believed to be temporarily airborne.  Though Stewart repeatedly promised to show me his original VA contract pitch, he ultimately declined to share it. What is clear is that FGE, which is designated as a Service-Disabled Veteran-Owned Small Business, had a competitive advantage in securing work at the VA, which sets aside certain contracts for small veteran-owned companies. Stewart declined to talk about how he qualifies as disabled.  Stewart said his deal’s cost was being driven up by high demand and by the brokers trying to collect “success fees.” While he said King never disclosed his fees, he showed me another contract with a different broker. That offer, which FGE declined, would have paid 5 cents a mask — about $300,000 — to the broker setting up the deal.  Ken Curley, a retired Army colonel whose company works with local governments and hospitals to order masks outside of this emerging black market, called the FGE deal “absolutely” a case of price gouging. “So you have a $4.90 mask before you put it on a truck?” he said. “It’s insanity.”  Curley’s company, Raymond Associates LLC, drafted a best practices paper for buyers like local hospitals, pointing out that 3M’s list price for masks like those Stewart was attempting to purchase was $1.27. After shipping costs and overhead, the end price should realistically be around $2 a mask, he said.  “So anybody that’s above that number is gouging,” Curley said. “And they know it.”  Curley said he’s seen numerous offers for respirators, many of which did not really exist, and turned away brokers working through multiple layers of intermediaries. To avoid this, he recommends “a single line” between the distributor and the government agency buying the product, meaning there’s only one facilitator.  Sergio Fernández de Córdova, who chairs a media nonprofit in New York, is working with Curley to help government agencies get reputable masks at better prices. Government agencies are partly to blame, he said, because they’re desperately handing out big contracts to unknown companies and paying exorbitant prices for whatever comes back. In the FGE deal, for instance, the VA essentially set its high price when it agreed to 6 million units at $34.5 million.  “They’re approving it,” he said. “So that’s why people don’t see a problem with it.”  Though several states have clear price gouging laws, those rules don’t apply to federal government purchases.  “It is the Wild West and a loophole — that’s why so many lawyers are involved,” Fernández de Córdova said. “We’ve seen deals with lawyers making a couple hundred grand.”  3M has filed lawsuits in at least five states against people selling its respirators and masks at obscene markups. The Justice Department is also hunting down alleged scammers, such as two California men who were arrested for selling Chinese versions of the N95 respirators, KN95s, which they didn’t actually possess.  Stewart had read about those cases and had been given a copy of Curley’s best practices memo, and it clearly worried him.  “I’m just trying to fulfill my obligation and not go to jail,” he said.  Empty Hotel, Empty Promises  At 11 a.m. Saturday, Flight N407FX skidded onto warm asphalt in Columbus.  Stewart’s mother and father were waiting with luggage, while a few other family members came by to take pictures.  Also joining us was Dawn Lockhart, Stewart’s friend from middle school whom he had hired as FGE’s human resources director. She, like me, had been told by Stewart that everyone on board would have access to an N95 mask for protection on the flight. But there were none.  Despite his company’s moniker, there seemed nothing expert about this operation. Stewart said his company lawyer had missed the flight because he slept in. Lockhart, who joked that she was wearing a skirt and heels for the first time in three years, was flipping through a textbook titled “Strategic Staffing.”  Stewart was building his company, like this deal, in midflight.  Once we were airborne, Stewart said he had found a new mask supplier in Atlanta who could quickly deliver to Chicago.  He said that once we landed he would drop his folks off at the Hilton Oak Brook Hills Resort just outside of Chicago and then he and I would take a taxi over to the VA distribution center and wait for a mask delivery “even if we have to wait until 3 a.m.”  But we never left the confines of the vast and vacant Hilton, where two employees sat bored behind makeshift plexiglass barriers.  In the lobby, Stewart worked the phones. He needed the VA to sign off on his new arrangement, but to win approval, he needed invoices and other documentation that he said King wasn’t sending over.  Just before 2 p.m., King had sent the “proof of life” video that Stewart said he’d been asking for, according to text messages Stewart later shared. The grainy cellphone video pans over what appear to be hundreds of boxes labeled 3M, but it was unclear what was in the boxes or where they were.  By 3 p.m. Stewart had been joined by several friends and associates, including Roosevelt “Trey” Daniels of Frontline Recovery, a Houston disaster recovery firm. Daniels connected FGE to King .  Stewart and Daniels made dozens of calls — to King, to trucking companies, to cargo jet owners. “Hey, Frank,” Daniels said into his cell. “Who is a good freight company?” And that would lead to the next call and the next.  By 5:20, Daniels had suggested they send a portion of the shipment by truck to Illinois, while they figured out how to get the rest on planes. Stewart insisted that he wanted to get the whole shipment there at once.  Then, a new idea emerged. Maybe they could buy some time by getting the VA to agree to an extension. Daniels had worked as a district director for U.S. Rep. Sheila Jackson Lee , a Texas Democrat, and got her office to draft a letter in support of FGE .  “Can you lend your voice to this veteran-owned, African American business?” Roosevelt said he asked the congresswoman. “And she said yes. She’s always willing to go to bat for folks who are trying to do the right thing.”  Stewart drafted a formal extension request, citing provisions in federal contracting law. As the evening wore on, what was at first frenetic determination to pull off a miracle subsided into resignation and then into finger-pointing — at King, the VA bureaucracy, the market itself.  Daniels says the deal went south because King and Stewart faced a challenging market, trying to move cash too fast, while the federal government doesn’t provide enough guidance for vendors.  “This situation with Troy King and Rob Stewart is you really have two good guys who had a lot of miscommunications,” he said. “One wasn’t communicating enough. One had his back against the wall.”  “Robert Stewart is a good guy,” Daniels said. “He’s a very honest guy.”  The group ordered tacos for what Stewart said was the company’s “last supper.” “I’ve done everything I can do,” Stewart said. “I called in every favor I had.”  A Federal Investigation  The next morning, as the dejected party boarded for a return flight, the pilot asked: “Anything I can get you before we take off?”  “Six million N95 masks,” Stewart quipped.  We landed in Georgia an hour and a half later, Stewart snapped photos with his family in front of the jet, and the two of us took off for Dulles.  The CEO was in the same gray suit as the previous day, now wrinkled. With his friends and family gone, his joviality had given way to exhaustion and the realization that this article probably wasn’t going to be one he liked. The optics of the private jet, he said, would not be good.  “The only reason I took the plane was because of my parents,” he said. “They’re old and I didn’t want them to get sick, and I wanted them to see this. I wanted to say thank you.”  Stewart said he had severed ties with King the previous night. Stewart said he and his team couldn’t track down any Juanita Ramos, the connection King purported to have to Pence’s task force. And King hadn’t sent over the invoice he needed for the VA.  “I absolutely do believe he made her up,” Stewart said Wednesday. King did not respond to a question about Ramos.  “He’s the one that made up this figment Ramos lady,” Stewart added. “I didn’t make that up.”  “After several conversations over the weekend, Mr. Stewart informed us that he had secured these masks through another source and that he would not need our services to secure the masks,” King said through a spokesperson. “There have been no further conversations between Mr. Stewart and me. No agreement was ever made, no contract was ever executed, and no money was ever exchanged.”  Stewart believes there were never any masks in LA or Atlanta.  “Every time you get ready to do the due diligence or whatever else — you ask to see the proof of life — people go: ‘Oh, well we don’t have that. We have this kind. Or we can’t do that until this week or this date.’ Stuff just never materializes. It’s a bunch of smoke and mirrors and ghosts.”  Stewart, to the end, maintained he would find a way to get masks to the VA. He followed up with the VA, offering a contract to get on a production line directly from 3M , at a cheaper cost, just $3.77 a mask.  But the VA terminated the deal Wednesday, after I inquired with the agency and a spokesperson for Pence’s task force. The agency didn’t tell Stewart directly, though he said he was made aware of the IG investigation.  “The story is that we started out trying to do the best thing for the country,” Stewart said. “I failed in that, ultimately.”  Back in DC, I asked a VA spokesperson why any of this, the FGE contract and intermediaries, was even necessary. Couldn’t the VA just buy masks directly?  The agency is waiting, along with much of the federal government, on FEMA, said spokeswoman Christina Noel. More than 166 million respirators are being produced by 3M under the Defense Production Act over the next few months, “some of which are being provided to the VA.”  In the meantime, the VA was hiring contractors to scour for additional masks.  “To meet the remainder of its N95 respirator needs, VA conducts additional acquisition activities with other vendors,” Noel said.  In the end, the VA ended up with precisely zero additional N95 masks from its deal with Stewart.  On the up side, the VA paid no money to FGE, Noel said.  As of Wednesday, more than 2,200 VA employees had tested positive for COVID-19.   Do you have access to information about federal contracts that should be public? Email david.mcswane@propublica.org .

"Grubhub receipt sparks outrage as it reveals the company took a $666 cut from a pizza restaurant's $1,042 in total orders  01 May 2020, 19:55 by Irene Jiang   Giuseppe Badalamenti, the owner of Chicago Pizza Boss, posted his March Grubhub earnings statement on Facebook, and it showed that the delivery platform took about 70% of its $1,000 earnings through the platform.  ""Stop believing you are supporting your community by ordering from a 3rd party delivery company,"" Badalamenti wrote on Facebook.  ""Restaurant owners select the services they want and only pay a commission to Grubhub when we help generate sales,"" a Grubhub spokesperson told Business Insider.  Grubhub, which is part of the same company as Seamless, has come under scrutiny for asking users to oppose San Francisco's order to slash its commission fees for restaurants from an average of 30% to 15%.  Visit Business Insider's homepage for more stories .   Grubhub says it helps local restaurants. One email sent to customers reads, ""Join us in supporting local restaurants during this difficult time.""  But an Illinois pizzeria owner caused a stir by posting a Grubhub earnings statement that shows the delivery platform taking the lion's share of his delivery earnings. Giuseppe Badalamenti, who owns Chicago Pizza Boss in Westmont, Illinois, wrote, ""Stop believing you are supporting your community by ordering from a 3rd party delivery company.""  The statement shows that out of a total of $1,042 generated by 46 orders through the platform, Grubhub took a $206.51 commission, a $94.99 delivery commission, a $38.52 processing fee, $231 for promotions, and $131.19 for a seven-order adjustment with $36.12 deducted. The seven-order adjustment refers to a $7 promotional discount that restaurants can choose to opt in to.  ""Out of almost $1,100 of orders, your restaurant you are trying to support receives not even $400. It is almost enough to pay for the food,"" Badalamenti wrote.  Guardian reporter Susie Cagle shared Badalamenti's post on Twitter and described it as ""nightmarish."" Cagle's post garnered 17,000 likes and 7,700 retweets as of Friday afternoon, and Twitter users expressed their outrage in the thread.              ""Restaurant owners select the services they want and only pay a commission to Grubhub when we help generate sales. Grubhub is happy to work with restaurant partners to help them manage costs and grow their business,"" a Grubhub spokesperson told Business Insider in an email.  The spokesperson also said that according to a study conducted by Grubhub, restaurant owners keep an average of 75% of their sales through the platform.  Some cities have enacted caps on the commission fees that third-party delivery platforms like Grubhub are allowed to charge restaurants. On April 24, Seattle passed an emergency order limiting those commission fees to 15%. When San Francisco passed a similar order in early April, Grubhub asked its users to oppose San Francisco's order, saying that it would force the company to pass on costs to customers.

Uber Must Face Rape Victim Suit Over Attacker’s Window Decal  01 May 2020, 19:02 by Malathi Nayak   Woman who got in wrong car says Uber logo reassured her  Court reinstated case after previously dismissing in November   Uber Technologies Inc. must face negligence claims by a woman who says she mistakenly got into a car bearing the company’s windshield decal and was subsequently raped by the driver.  U.S. Magistrate Judge Jacqueline Corley in San Francisco ruled Friday the woman could proceed on claims that Uber should have instructed the alleged assailant, a suspended driver for the ride-hailing service, to remove and return the decal. The victim claims the Uber logo gave her assurance she was getting a “safe ride.”  Corley’s decision reinstates the case based on an amended complaint. Uber got the original lawsuit dismissed last November after Corley decided the rape did not take place within the scope of the driver’s employment.  Uber declined to comment on Friday’s ruling.  The ruling comes as the ride-sharing industry, including Uber’s competitor Lyft , has faced scrutiny over passenger safety. A litany of sexual assault complaints by both passengers and drivers has pushed the company to take measures such as the introduction of a feature that allows users to text 911 from the Uber app.   Read More: Uber Passenger Says Decal Duped Her to Get Into Rapist’s Car   According to the complaint she filed in June 2019, the woman thought the car that picked her up at a San Francisco Bay area shopping mall in August had been dispatched by her fiance, but the driver took her to a secluded location and raped her. She claimed Uber knew the driver was a “menace to women” because it suspended him in June 2018 after a woman complained that he had “behaved disturbingly” while giving her a ride.  The driver had also previously been arrested or convicted of offenses including driving under the influence of a controlled substance, vehicle theft, vandalism, assault and domestic violence, the woman alleged. She did not identify the driver, but the details match those of a criminal case against former Uber driver Brandon Sherman, who is facing kidnapping and rape charges in San Mateo County, California.  Corley rejected Uber’s argument that negligence claims were barred because a California law regulates the use of decals. The company failed to show how a finding that it “should not have authorized the assailant to use its trade dress and should have retrieved the trade dress when it terminated him upon learning of his conduct would undermine” the state law, the magistrate said.  She dismissed the woman’s claims of false imprisonment, assault and battery “by an ostensible agent.”  (Adds Uber declining to comment)	News
Head of Criminal Assets Bureau promoted to top Garda ranks  01 May 2020, 19:44 by Conor Lally  The head of the Criminal Assets Bureau (Cab), Det Chief Supt Pat Clavin, has been promoted to the top ranks in the Garda, at assistant commissioner level.  Mr Clavin was one of three officers to secure promotion to assistant commissioner rank during a recent recruitment competition, along with Chief Supt Ann Marie Cagney and PSNI Det Chief Paula Hilman.  Garda Commissioner Drew Harris announced on Friday that Mr Clavin’s appointment had now been made by the Policing Authority.  “This appointment is very welcome. Pat has 38 years of policing experience across a wide variety of roles and areas in An Garda Síochána,” Mr Harris said.  “His operational and professional standards experience will be of immense benefit to the organisation.”  In his most recent role as head of Cab, Mr Clavin led the bureau’s successful pursuit of Dublin criminal Liam Byrne (39), Crumlin, Dublin. He was named in the High Court as the head of the Byrne organised crime group and a Dublin-based lieutenant of the Kinahan cartel. Some €2.7 million of assets, including property, were seized from the Byrne organised crime group during the Cab investigation into them.  “One thing we find particularly telling is the number of modest homes with bullet proof windows and doors,” Mr Clavin told the Irish Times in an interview just over a year after taking over at Cab.  He said this was a major change compared to the organised crime scene when he joined the force. “When I joined the police in the 1980s we were told there were two crime families in Ireland. One was called the Cahills and the other was called the Dunnes,” he said, a referring to Martin Cahill and brothers Christy and Larry Dunne.  “The Cahills were involved in burglaries and robberies and the Dunnes were credited with bringing heroin into Ireland.”  Under Mr Clavin’s stewardship the bureau established a social media presence and invited members of the public to give the bureau tip-offs online in a bid to modernise its operations and reach out to the public.  While major crime gangs in all regions of the Republic continued to be targeted, the bureau significantly increased the number of gardaí trained to identify unexplained wealth and profile the assets of suspects in their areas.  Those profiles were then passed to Cab’s Dublin offices and hundreds of new investigations were commenced into mid tier criminals from whom cash, vehicles, expensive jewellery and clothing were seized.  That move sought to take full advantage of changes to the Proceeds of Crime Act which was amended to ensure the bureau could target criminal assets valued as low as €5,000 rather than the previous minimum value of €13,000.  Before taking on the lead position at Cab four years ago Mr Clavin worked in senior management posts in the Garda’s Professional Standards Unit and Internal Affairs. He was also previously chief superintendent in charge of the Dublin West Garda division as well as holding the position of superintendent in a number of Garda districts.	News
"Brazil is letting the coronavirus run wild with little intervention, and the results are strikingly bad  01 May 2020, 21:51 by Kelly McLaughlin   Brazil, which has a population of more than 209 million, has reported more than 91,000 confirmed cases of COVID-19 and at least 6,300 deaths from the virus.  Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro has downplayed the virus for weeks and even encouraged protesters calling for state-issued lockdowns to be lifted.  The country has yet to hit its peak in COVID-19 cases, and experts worry that the case count and death toll could be much higher than reported.  Visit Business Insider's homepage for more stories .   Brazil is facing an extreme surge in COVID-19 cases after the government left the virus to spread virtually uncontrolled for weeks, all while the country's president mocked stay-at-home policies and pushed against directives from the World Health Organization.  As of Friday evening, Brazil, which has a population of 209 million, had 91,589 confirmed cases of COVID-19 and 6,329 deaths from the virus, according to Johns Hopkins data . That makes the country's per-capita death rate 3.02 deaths per 100,000 people.  Experts told The Associated Press that the numbers of cases and deaths could be much higher because Brazil does not yet have widespread testing.  Since the novel coronavirus started to spread across the world, countries have issued lockdowns, stay-at-home orders, and curfews to help contain outbreaks. Even Sweden, which has left restaurants, schools, and public spaces open , has urged its residents to social distance and stay home when necessary.  But in Brazil, there's an alarmingly relaxed approach from the country's president, Jair Bolsonaro — the only stay-at-home orders in place have been issued by governors, borders are still open, and there are very few countrywide quarantine regulations.  Brazil's president has downplayed the novel coronavirus pandemic for weeks    Funeral homes in Manaus fear they'll run out of wooden coffins in days. Bruno Kelly/Reuters   Bolsonaro has downplayed the coronavirus pandemic for weeks and even encouraged protesters who pushed against lockdown measures put in place by 25 out of the country's 27 governors.  Across the country, cities are facing the bleak realities of the virus, which experts say is still weeks from its peak.  Manaus, the capital of the state of Amazonas, has started digging mass graves for COVID-19 victims , and funeral homes fear they'll run out of wooden coffins in days. In Rio de Janeiro, pictures posted on Twitter showed bodies lined up outside a hospital because the morgue was full.  LoadingSomething is loading.  Brazil's extraordinarily low testing rate — 32 times lower than in the US, which is still looking to ramp up its own testing, according to The Washington Post — is so low that hospital patients and medical workers are not being tested for the virus.  According to the latest report from Pantheon Macroeconomics , an economic-research consultancy firm, Brazil wasn't hit hard by the virus until late March or early April, but the number of new cases is growing by the day.  Pantheon's report suggested Brazil's surge in cases was likely a consequence of Bolsonaro's ""unhinged view of the virus.""  As Bolsonaro downplays the virus, he has also argued with governors over state-imposed lockdowns and suggested the World Health Organization encouraged masturbation and homosexuality among children, according to the AFP .  Brazil's neighbors are concerned about the country's open borders    As of May 1, 6,329 had died from the disease in Brazil. Bruno Kelly/Reuters   Brazil's neighboring leaders have raised concern over the country's approach to the virus.  In Paraguay, soldiers dug a trench at its border with Brazil to prevent people from crossing over. In Uruguay, President Luis Lacalle Pou told The AP Brazil's reaction to the virus was sending ""warning lights"" to his administration.  Argentine President Alberto Fernández told local news outlets Saturday, according to The AP, that he was worried about the open borders.  ""A lot of traffic is coming from São Paulo, where the infection rate is extremely high, and it doesn't appear to me that the Brazilian government is taking it with the seriousness that it requires,"" he said. ""That worries me a lot, for the Brazilian people and also because it can be carried to Argentina.""  Sergio Davila, the editor in chief of the Brazilian newspaper Folha de S.Paulo, told The New Yorker that other branches of government were standing their ground against Bolsonaro, and that could help in the long run.  ""The Supreme Court is doing its job. The Congress is doing its job. It is turning down a lot of exotic propositions from the executive,"" he said. ""The Supreme Court is doing the same. It is knocking down executive orders that are not democratic, such as the one I mentioned about overturning the power of the states. So the system of checks and balances is working. But you have to know that Brazil is a relatively new democracy, not like the United States. It's under stress, but it is doing well so far. So I am optimistic. The press is doing a great job as well.""  But Bolsonaro seems unfazed by the death toll, The New York Times reported .  ""So what? Sorry, but what do you want me to do?"" he said this week. ""My name is Messiah, but I can't work miracles.""   Do you have a personal experience with the coronavirus you'd like to share? Or a tip on how your town or community is handling the pandemic?

There’s now a $50 camera for your Raspberry Pi with interchangeable lenses  01 May 2020, 21:30 by C. Scott Brown     Raspberry Pi Foundation Source: Raspberry Pi Foundation  If you are a Raspberry Pi tinkerer, you likely already know about the $30 Camera Module V2 . While that will allow you to capture photos and videos with your Raspberry Pi , it certainly is no powerhouse. The new Raspberry Pi camera , though, is something else altogether.  Officially dubbed the Raspberry Pi High-Quality Camera , this new sensor has a few tricks up its sleeve that the CMV2 simply doesn’t have. The biggest new aspect of the new camera is that it has interchangeable lenses. In fact, the $50 price of the High-Quality Camera doesn’t even include a lens — that’s just for the sensor, mount, and ribbon connector.  Resellers will be offering a couple of lens options for the new Raspberry Pi camera: a 6mm CS‑mount lens for $25 and a 16mm C-mount lens for $50.  However, you don’t need to buy those lenses if you don’t want to. Since the camera has a relatively common mount on it, you could connect compatible lenses you already own. If you don’t have any, there are likely inexpensive adapters online that will make your existing lenses compatible.  For example, check out this photo that appears to show a Canon EF 70-200mm f/2.8L IS II USM attached to a Raspberry Pi with the new module:     Raspberry Pi Foundation Source: Raspberry Pi Foundation  The other new bit to the Raspberry Pi High-Quality Camera is the sensor itself. The V2 was a relatively old smartphone sensor, but this is a 12.3MP Sony IMX477 sensor with 1.55 µm pixels and a 7.81mm diagonal. In non-photography-expert speak, that’s a sensor that sends the V2 home to cry in shame.  With the simplicity of a Raspberry Pi computer and the versatility of a high-quality camera sensor with nearly limitless options for lenses, this new camera will likely make tinkerers pretty happy.

"Kroger limiting ground beef, pork purchases in some stores   01 May 2020, 21:23   May 1 (Reuters) - Supermarket chain Kroger Co said on Friday it has put purchase limits on ground beef and fresh pork at some of its stores following growing concerns over meat shortages due to coronavirus-induced supply disruptions.  The world's biggest meat companies, including Smithfield Foods Inc, Cargill Inc, JBS USA and Tyson Foods Inc, have halted operations at about 20 slaughterhouses and processing plants in North America as workers fall ill, stoking global fears of a meat shortage.  Earlier this week, U.S. President Donald Trump ordered meat-processing plants to stay open to protect the food supply in the country.  ""There is plenty of protein in the supply chain. However, some processors are experiencing challenges,"" a Kroger spokesperson said.  The news of the purchase restrictions was first reported by CNN, and the report added Walmart Inc does not expect it will have to set product limits on meat.

A bridge between farmers and buyers  A young marketing graduate of Basavanabagewadi taluk buys horticulture crops straight from the field and sells them to big shops in cities  01 May 2020, 07:01 by Firoz Rozindar  At the time when horticulture farmers are struggling to sell their produces, because of the lockdown, a marketing graduate has come as saviour to many such farmers of the district with his registered agency.  Jagadish Sunagad (25), native of Kolhar village of Basavanabagewadi taluk, has already made transactions of over ₹60 lakh by directly buying horticulture crops such as watermelon, onion, banana and other vegetables from the farmers.  Having registered his Basavanabagewadi Horticulture Farmer Producer Company in June 2017, the agency acts as a bridge between farmers and the buyers.  With over 1000 farmers already registered with his agency to supply horticulture crops, Mr. Sunagad said that lockdown has given more significance to the agency. “During lockdown, the farmers are anxious as they are not getting buyers. Their commodity is either getting perished in the farm itself, or they are forced to sell at dirt-cheap price. Our agency came forward to help the farmers find a market.”  Mr. Sunagad told The Hindu said that he purchases the commodity and sells it back in two ways: locally and to other cities.  “If I procure small quantities of fruits and vegetables, I sell them locally in the taluk where I get many buyers; in case of large quantities many multi-brand shops in Bengaluru buy from me. I receive orders in bulk, so I transport large quantities of fruits and vegetables to them.”  He also sells the produce to similar agencies of different districts. “I buy the commodities that I don’t have from other agencies. Similarly they buy from me what they don’t have. We later sell them to multi-brand shops.”  He claimed that so far, he has sold over 200 tonnes of watermelon, over 500 tonnes of onion, over 700 tonnes of banana and over 50 tonnes of vegetables.  Girish Telagi, a banana farmer of Kolhar village, is one such beneficiary of Mr. Sunagad’s company. Having cultivated banana in his four-acre farm, he was not finding buyers during lockdown.  “I normally get buyers from Belagavi, but after lockdown, they did not come. My commodity was getting wasted at the farm itself. At that time, I came to know about Mr. Sunagad. When I contacted him, he came to my farm and purchased around 50 tonnes of banana for a good price. He pays money within couple of days itself. Otherwise I would have incurred heavy loss”, he said.  Mr. Jagadish Sunagad could be contacted on 9845068960	NotNews
WATCH | Phased reopening of SA’s education systems: What you need to know  01 May 2020, 07:12 by Timeslive Multimedia      Basic education minister Angie Motshekga and higher education minister Blade Nzimande outlined the plan for a phased reopening of schools and institutions of higher learning at a media briefing.  Motshekga said the “proposed dates” for grade 7 and 12 pupils is 1 June 2020. Thereafter a phased reopening for the rest of the grades would follow, depending on when it will be safe to have children in classrooms.  Nzimande said institutions of higher learning would remain closed until further notice.  He said there are plans to make all the necessary resources available for students to be able to study and participate through virtual learning. Final year medical students and students within clinical practices would be the exception as they would return to universities and colleges next week.  As the country enters level 4 of the national lockdown today, ministers stressed the importance of saving lives rather than succumbing to external pressures to reopen schools.	NotNews
"Chris Gayle has levelled false allegations: Ramnaresh Sarwan  01 May 2020, 07:59 by IANS  NEW DELHI: Former West Indies cricketer Ramnaresh Sarwan has broken his silence after his former teammate Chris Gayle took to social media to hit out at him. Gayle had earlier accused Sarwan for engineering his ouster from Caribbean Premier League side Jamaica Tallawahs .  ""I categorically deny any involvement in the decision, or the decision-making process, which led to Gayle's non-selection to represent the Jamaica Tallawahs in the 2020 Caribbean Premier League ( CPL ) Tournament,"" Sarwan was quoted as saying by ESPNcricinfo on his Facebook page.  ""In that video, he has levelled false allegations and tarnished the good name and reputation of a series of persons.  ""I was the focus of most of the onslaughts. I reply, not because I feel that Gayle's rantings are worthy of it, but because I feel that the public's record must be set straight and also, to protect the character and careers of so many people, whose image he sought to besmirch,"" he added.   News in Brief    Explore Briefs   Gayle had earlier referred to Sarwan as a 'snake' and he even went on to the extent of saying that he was 'worse than coronavirus'.  ""Let me make this abundantly clear that I played with Gayle since the inception of my career. I have always respect him as an extraordinary talent, a colleague and most importantly as a close friend. Hence, my utter shock at these allegations,"" said Sarwan.  Tallawahs have also said that Sarwan had nothing to do with Gayle not being retained by the franchise.  ""Gayle gave several reasons for the decision that was made not to retain him in the Tallawahs. However, the truth is that this decision was made collectively by the Ownership and Management team which did not include Ramnaresh Sarwan and based purely on business and cricketing reasoning,"" Tallawahs said in a statement on their official website."

"Apple Revenues Flat in Q2 Amid Coronavirus Pandemic  The company also avoided releasing its guidance for the quarter ending in June, though it usually does, explaining it is due to the global uncertainty amid COVID-19.   01 May 2020, 00:40   Apple experienced flat revenues in the second quarter of 2020 amid the novel coronavirus pandemic, CNBC News reported on Thursday.  The company saw revenue growth of $58.3 billion in Q2, but its shares went down over 2 percent in extended trading on Thursday.  Apple CEO Tim Cook expressed optimism about the company's long-term performance, but said that right now, it was difficult to judge about ""what the next 60 days look like"" due to ""that lack of visibility and uncertainty"" amid the pandemic.  ""Amid the most challenging global environment in which we've ever operated our business, we're proud to say that Apple grew during the quarter"", Cook said in an interview with CNBC . ""It was a very unique quarter. I’ve never had anything quite like this. I hope to never have it again, but I'm incredibly proud of the company and what was achieved during that period of time.""  In mid-April, Apple released its second-generation iPhone SE - a newer version of the iPhone SE that debuted in 2016. The release came without in-person events due to the lockdown measures induced by COVID-19.  The new coronavirus pandemic has infected more than 3 million and killed over 233,000 people worldwide, according to Johns Hopkins University. The virus was first identified in China's Wuhan, later spreading to the rest of the world. On 11 March, the World Health Organisation declared the COVID-19 outbreak a pandemic."	News

The Samsung Galaxy A21s is cleared for launch by the Bluetooth SIG, may be destined for several new markets  01 May 2020 by Deirdre O Donnell   Samsung has been rumored to have a Galaxy A21s ready for release this year. A new leak confirms this, referring to the phone by its name for the first time. Interestingly, the new device is now associated with 5 slightly different model numbers, suggesting that it will be available in multiple regions.   Today (May 1, 2020), the Bluetooth Special Interest Group (SIG) has inadvertently confirmed that the Samsung Galaxy A20s will be updated with a new generation soon. This new phone has only been the stuff of rumors until now; however, we may now say it is a Bluetooth 5.0 device, at least.  According to this new certification , the A21s may have up to 5 different variants, each of which may be headed to different markets. One of these (the SM-A217F/DSN) has also been spotted on the Wi-Fi Alliance's website, although this body did not affirm its product name overtly. The others are SM-A217M, SM-A217M/DS, SM-A217F/DS and SM-A217N.  These model numbers may indicate that the Galaxy A21s is destined for various different markets, which based on the evidence may include the US , India and South Korea . In addition, it is possible that some or all of them may integrate a new Exynos processor called the 850 . The Galaxy A21s is also currently thought to improve on the existing A21 with a 48MP main camera sensor, a bigger battery and a slightly larger screen.        The Galaxy A21s' new certification.

"F1 News: Hungarian GP behind closed doors if it goes ahead in 2020  01 May 2020 by Adam Cooper   Hungarian Grand Prix organisers have confirmed that the Formula 1 race will take place without fans if it happens in 2020, and have offered refunds to ticket holders.   The news comes after the government extended the ban on events with more than 500 people until August 15.  Even a closed doors race at the Hungaroring would comfortably break that limit, but it's understood that the government would accept that it is a broadcast operation, and not a public event.  The race is still officially scheduled for August 2, and it's not clear what date is now on the table in discussions with the Formula 1 organisation.  However sources indicate that it is likely to be outside the current limit of the ban anyway.  ""The decision by the Hungarian government barring events with over 500 people from taking place in the country until August 15th has clearly had a direct impact on the [race},"" the organisers said in a statement given to Autosport.  ""The Hungaroring team has been regularly liaising with Formula 1 to explore all possible ways to stage [the race] in front of fans.     ""However, in light of this decision this is unfortunately no longer possible.  ""The health and well-being of all our fantastic Formula 1 fans, staff and championship participants has been and remains our primary concern throughout this period and with that in mind, we have regrettably been left with no choice but to reach this conclusion.  ""We have continuously emphasised our willingness to work towards a safe solution that would allow us to welcome the entire Formula 1 family to the Hungaroring this August but it is now evident that any F1 race in Hungary can now only be held behind closed doors.  ""While this is not an ideal scenario, we do believe that staging the event behind closed doors - which our fans can still watch on television - is preferable to not having a race at all.  ""Furthermore, it will also ensure that a global audience of millions can still watch the race taking place in Hungary via F1's vast international broadcast coverage.  ""As such, we are continuing our working with Formula 1 to try and find a way to make this possible.""  Fans have been offered either a refund or the opportunity to transfer their ticket to 2021."

Digital Identity: Eftpos Australia to Begin Testing its Mass-Market Online Customer ID Service, backed by Leading Banks, Merchants  01 May 2020, 00:56 by Omar Faridi     Eftpos (electronic funds transfer at point of sale) Australia confirmed that it will begin running pilots of a mass-market digital identity service, which is reportedly backed by the nation’s leading banks and merchants.  According to a document submitted to the Australian government’s Select Committee on Financial Technology and Regulatory Technology , Eftpos Australia has developed a proof-of-concept (PoC) of the digital identity solution with 17 local companies and is planning to move to a trial phase.  The company said it wants to implement a “smoother, faster and more secure onboarding experience,” which would include virtual identity solutions for various government services.  The solution will also aim to offer privacy-protecting ways to hand out government money. Personal user information related to social security, disaster relief efforts, healthcare services and small business assistance will be stored in a secure manner.  The company noted:   “With access to more than 40 million bank accounts utilizing bank verification systems with eftpos’ capability, we are uniquely placed to provide digital Identity services with the support of Australian Issuing banks.   It added:   “Customers can rely on eftpos’ reach and payments data access to utilize their credentials without having to input their data time and again.”   The solution aims to prevent fraudulent activities, which includes protecting local residents from serious identity theft crimes. It will also offer affordable access to new marketplaces and channels to Australian Fintech firms.  Eftpos Australia further noted:   “It makes sense for Eftpos to provide this service because we are Australian-based and our transactions are processed here… Eftpos is not owned by or beholden to any other commercial provider so it can operate as a neutral provider of digital identity solutions, maximizing their take up and use across the broader economy.”   The company says there will most likely be a “critical need for increased competition in digital payments ,” and that a reliable digital identity solution could help Fintech firms that are focused on providing improved financial services and infrastructure.

Diamond Platnumz to lose Sh3.5 billion due to Coronavirus  01 May 2020 by The Citizen Reporter  Tanzania’s Bongo Flava star Diamond Platnumz is set to lose up to Sh3.5 billion in earnings in 2020 due restrictions put on social gatherings because of the coronavirus outbreak. Diamond says he had 30 planned shows which all now been either cancelled or postponed to a later date. Speaking to Mvumo TV the ‘Jeje’ singer said the outbreak of the Coronavirus pandemic has disrupted operations in the entertainment industry. “Entertainment depends of gatherings. I had shows in Europe, America and Africa which have all been cancelled due to the Covid-19 pandemic and that as an artiste means loss of income to me personally and to the label.” According to Diamond, this is bound to affect several things including payment of salaries because at the end of the day some of the people who work at the label do not depend on show and have to be paid monthly salaries. But even then he looked upbeat saying that they were lucky to have built a large online following which means that they can still earn some money from the online platforms. The singer recently pledged to pay three-month rent for 500 families in Dar es Salaam who were faced with difficulties due to the outbreak of the pandemic which has ravaged global economies. Though Tanzania is yet to impose a lockdown and curfew like those imposed in some neighbouring countries such as Rwanda, Uganda and Kenya where social gatherings are prohibited to prevent the spread of the virus.

Old drugs may find a new purpose: fighting the coronavirus   01 May 2020, 09:46    In the early 1950s, psychiatrists began treating schizophrenia with a new drug called chlorpromazine. Seven decades later, the drug is still used as an anti-psychotic.   But now scientists have discovered that the drug, also known as Thorazine, can do something entirely different. It can stop the new coronavirus that causes COVID-19 from invading cells.  Driven by the pandemic’s spread, research teams have been screening thousands of drugs to see if they have this unexpected potential to fight the coronavirus. They’ve tested the drugs on dishes of cells, and a few dozen candidates have made the first cut.  They’re startlingly diverse. Some, like chlorpromazine, have been used for years — not for viral infections, but for conditions including cancer, allergies, arthritis, even irregular menstrual periods. Other drugs have not yet been approved by the Food and Drug Administration, but they have already proven safe in clinical trials. Their track records might help them get approved faster than a drug designed from scratch.  As researchers publish findings on these promising drugs, they’re starting tests on animals and people to see how well they perform.  “I’m going to be brutally honest with you: 95 to 98% of these are going to fail,” said Sumit K Chanda, a virologist at Sanford Burnham Prebys Medical Discovery Institute in La Jolla, California. “But we only need one or two.”   DRUGS WITH HIDDEN POWERS   The strategy Chanda and other researchers are using is known as drug repurposing. It has a history that started decades before COVID-19 appeared. In 1987, for example, the cancer drug zidovudine became the first FDA-approved drug against HIV.  The most obvious drugs to repurpose against the new coronavirus are those that work against other viruses. One high-profile antiviral being investigated is remdesivir, which Gilead Sciences previously tested — unsuccessfully — as an antiviral against Ebola.  On Wednesday, Dr Anthony S Fauci, the federal government’s leading infectious diseases scientist, announced that a clinical trial showed that remdesivir may reduce the mortality rate of COVID-19 and can shorten the duration of the illness.  But over the years, researchers have found some drugs that originally had nothing to do with viruses turn out to be good antivirals, too. It’s just hard to tell in advance which ones have this hidden power.  “We don’t know a lot about why drugs do what they do,” said Matthew Frieman, a virologist at the University of Maryland School of Medicine.  In 2012, another coronavirus disease known as Middle East Respiratory Syndrome, or MERS, emerged. Frieman responded by starting a drug-repurposing study. He and his colleagues tested 290 FDA-approved drugs and found that 27 of them blocked the MERS virus from infecting cells. They also proved effective against the related coronavirus that causes Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS).  Frieman and his colleagues have now tested those drugs against the new coronavirus, and made a preliminary report that 17 of them showed promise. Along with chlorpromazine, they include drugs for disorders as varied as Parkinson’s disease and leukaemia.  Recently, Chanda’s team in California began a mammoth search of their own for drugs to repurpose for COVID-19. They doused infected cells with 13,000 compounds and looked for ones that slowed down the virus. They then narrowed down these candidates by reducing their doses, in order to mimic the levels that would end up in a patient’s lungs.  On April 17, Chanda’s team reported in a preprint, which has not yet been peer-reviewed by a journal, that six drugs showed particular promise, including one for osteoporosis and one that’s been investigated as treatment for arthritis.   TWO INTRIGUING PROTEIN TARGETS   Yet another team has been trying to find drugs that work against coronavirus — and also to learn why they work.  The team, led by Nevan Krogan at the University of California, San Francisco, has focused on how the new coronavirus takes over our cells at the molecular level.  The researchers determined that the virus manipulates our cells by locking onto at least 332 of our own proteins. By manipulating those proteins, the virus gets our cells to make new viruses.  Krogan’s team found 69 drugs that target the same proteins in our cells the virus does. They published the list in a preprint last month, suggesting that some might prove effective against COVID-19.  The researchers shipped the compounds to the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai in New York and at the Pasteur Institute in Paris. Those labs tried them out on infected cells.  Brian Shoichet, a pharmaceutical chemist at UCSF who helped build the list, was keenly aware of how often drug repurposing fails.  “I wasn’t that hopeful at all,” he said.  It turned out that most of the 69 candidates did fail. But both in Paris and New York, the researchers found that nine drugs drove the virus down.  “The things we’re finding are 10 to a hundred times more potent than remdesivir,” Krogan said. He and his colleagues published their findings Thursday in the journal Nature.  Strikingly, the drugs hit only two targets.  One group temporarily stops the creation of new proteins inside cells. This group includes molecules that are being tested as cancer drugs, such as ternatin-4 and Zotatifin.  Shoichet speculated that these compounds starve the virus of the proteins it needs to make new copies of itself. This attack may suddenly halt the viral production line.  “Viruses are actually delicate beasts,” he said.  The other compounds home in on a pair of proteins known as Sigma-1 and Sigma-2 receptors. These receptors are part of the cell’s communication network, helping the cell withstand stress in its environment.  Why does the new coronavirus need to manipulate Sigma receptors? “We don’t really know,” Shoichet said.  One possibility is that the virus uses Sigma receptors to make a cell produce more of the oily molecules that form membranes for new viruses.  Among the substances that act on Sigma receptors and block the virus, the researchers found, are the hormone progesterone and the drugs clemastine and cloperastine, both used against allergies.  In addition, Krogan said that all of Frieman’s candidates, including chlorpromazine, target Sigma receptors. A third of Chanda’s candidates do too, he said.  The researchers also tested dextromethorphan, a Sigma-receptor-targeting drug in many brands of cough syrup. They were surprised to find that, at least in their cell samples, it actually made infections of this coronavirus worse.  In their paper, the researchers raised the possibility that COVID-19 patients may want to avoid dextromethorphan. Krogan emphasized that more study would be needed to see if it actually increases coronavirus infection in humans. “But if it was me,” he said, to be cautious, “I would not be taking these cough syrups.”   ABOUT THOSE MALARIA DRUGS   The anti-malaria drugs chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine act on the Sigma receptor. Krogan’s team found that they also fought the virus in cells. Those compounds were extolled by President Donald Trump for weeks despite no firm evidence they actually helped cure COVID-19.  Frieman and Chanda also found that chloroquine-related drugs worked fairly well in slowing the virus in cell cultures. But Chanda found they didn’t work as well as the six compounds at the top of his list.  Chanda expressed scepticism about the chloroquine drugs, noting their failure against other viruses.  “We’ve been down this road multiple times,” he said. “I would be happy to be wrong about this.”  Last week, the FDA issued a warning against using hydroxychloroquine or chloroquine for COVID-19 outside the hospital setting or a clinical trial. That’s because the drug has a well-known risk for causing irregular heart rhythms.  In their new study, Krogan and his colleagues ran an experiment that might explain this risk at the molecular level.  They found that chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine bind not just to Sigma receptors, but to a heart protein called hERG, which helps control heartbeats.  “I think it’s a rational argument,” said Frieman, who was not involved in the Nature study. “Chloroquine does a lot of things in the cell.”  Krogan and his colleagues found that other compounds target Sigma proteins in a more promising way.  An experimental anticancer compound called PB28 is 20 times more potent than hydroxychloroquine against the coronavirus, for example. But it’s far less likely to grab onto the hERG protein.  Chanda said that PB28 in particular “looks really fantastic.”   NEXT STOP: HAMSTERS   Krogan said that studies are underway to test the drug in hamsters to see if that promise holds. Frieman and his colleagues are starting animal studies of their own, as well as testing drugs on a chip lined with human lung cells.  Timothy Sheahan, a virologist at the University of North Carolina who was not involved in the new studies cautioned that it will take more testing to make sure these promising drugs are safe to give to patients ravaged by COVID-19.  Cancer drugs, for example, can be “like a sledgehammer to your body,” he noted. “Are you going to want to do that when someone is really sick?”  In addition to animal tests and clinical trials, researchers are now planning to tweak the structure of these drugs to see if they can work even more effectively against the virus.  “Now we go crazy trying to make them more potent,” Krogan said.  c.2020 The New York Times Company	NotNews
On A Scale Of 1 To ‘Bachie’ Star Jarrod Bleaching His Hair, How Are You Doing In Iso?  01 May 2020, 09:45 by By PEDESTRIAN.TV  As someone who has bleached their hair twice before, let me tell you: bleaching your hair sounds fun… until it’s not. Like, it seems super great and lush for about 24 hours, and then it becomes a constant uphill battle to stop your head from looking like one large cheese ball. Still, that hasn’t stopped a large chunk of the Australian population, who’ve given themselves DIY bleaching jobs during peak iso boredom.  One such member of the population is ex- Bachie star Jarrod Woodgate , who jumped on the bleaching bandwagon this week.  Woodgate’s partner Sam Royce – who’s isolating with Woodgate up in Darwin – hilariously captured the DIY job every step of the way on her IG stories, and, uh, let me tell you, some moments had us afraid.  Like this one.    Instagram / @samroyceee   “Will the real Slim Shady please stand up,” Royce commented on the 34-year-old, at one point.     Then came this silver/purple look… which… was… a choice?    Instagram / @samroyceee   All momentary panic then subsided, as Royce ultimately revealed Jarrod’s more-redeemable final result.    Instagram / @samroyceee   PHEW. We thought we’d lost him there for a second.  Jarrod may have passed the test this time, and come out the other side relatively unscathed, but other couples in iso haven’t been so lucky. While we most certainly encourage self-expression in all its individual forms, sometime’s it’s best to tell your mate to put away the clippers or the hair dye.

Man Utd fans left fuming as new plan for Dean Henderson emerges   01 May 2020, 09:29    Manchester United fans are not happy after a new report claimed that Dean Henderson will be loaned out again next season and not be allowed to challenge David de Gea as the club’s No.1.   Henderson played a starring role in Sheffield United’s successful promotion bid last year and has also proven himself with the Blades in the Premier League, sitting joint-second in the clean sheets table prior to the suspension of the season.  The 23-year-old was expected to win a place in Gareth Southgate’s England squad for EURO 2020 before the tournament had to be rescheduled for 2021.  And with first-choice stopper de Gea’s form dropping off in recent months , Henderson has been tipped to compete for the number one jersey at Old Trafford – with MEN Sport stating that the goalkeeper only wants to return to the club if he will definitely be the top man.  ESPN reports United will resist any offers for the goalkeeper in the upcoming transfer window but will then look to send him out on loan for another season, as they continue to plan for his long-term future at the club.  And that decision has angered the Old Trafford faithful, as several comments were posted on Twitter .           At the start of April, legendary United stopper Peter Schmeichel didn’t help Henderson by stating that he has a long way to go before he challenges De Gea.  He said: “There’s no doubt about Henderson’s potential, but he’s played one season at a club who has had an unbelievable run in the Premier League.  “But Henderson will need to show another season, like he’s just come through, and then another one, and another one, in order to convince everyone that he is the right guy.  “There’s a really big difference between being the No.1 at Bramall Lane and being the No.1 at Old Trafford, a really big difference. Even just being a player at those two clubs.”  But whatever happens with the young stopper this summer, United are in an enviable position to have two such talented goalkeepers on their books in what must be a dream scenario for Ole Gunnar Solskjaer.  Meanwhile, Manchester United fully intend to sign Odion Ighalo this summer and have made the Nigerian loanee their No 1 priority when it comes to recruiting a new striker, claims a transfer expert.

Dumfries and Galloway Royal Infirmary seeing record low for accident and emergency visits  Officials fear that poorly locals are avoiding the NHS during the coronavirus pandemic  01 May 2020, 08:46 by Tracy Carmichael  Fewer people than ever are attending accident and emergency departments in the region as a result of the coronavirus crisis.  Officials fear that poorly locals are avoiding the NHS.  Dumfries and Galloway Royal Infirmary’s A&E unit is dealing with less than half the cases it saw come through its doors at the same time last year.  South of Scotland MSP Colin Smyth said: “My big fear is that if people do not seek help and advice now, the health service will face even more, non-Covid-19 related problems further down the line.”  NHS top brass fear patients suffering from other health conditions are avoiding seeking medical help during the pandemic.  New figures from the NHS show the lowest ever number of residents seeking treatment in the region’s accident and emergency departments.  In the week ending March 29 there were only 430 cases for casualty treatment in the region and 450 in the week ending April 12.  NHS figures show that 701 people attended A&E at the DGRI in the week ending April 14, 2019 and the total for the region was 988.  The Scottish Government has already launched a nationwide campaign amidst fears that patients are avoiding seeing their GP as a result of the coronavirus outbreak.  There has also been a fall in the number of cases where patients have been referred with suspected cancer, as well a drop in the number of parents presenting their children for routine immunisation programmes.  NHS Medical Director Dr Kenneth Donaldson said: “Anyone who requires urgent medical treatment should always attend their closest emergency department in the first instance.    Labour MSP Colin Smyth. (Image: Dumfries And Galloway Standard)   “Staff there will be able to help with everything from chest and abdominal pain to suspected stroke, breathing problems, a very sick child, severe bleeding and broken bones.  “Although a great deal of attention is focused on COVID-19, it’s important that people understand that services like the emergency department continue to operate normally.  Mr Smyth, the MSP, also urged residents who need treatment to seek medical help.  He said: “While none of us want to overburden our NHS at this terrible time, it is vitally important that those who require treatment feel confident to get in touch with their healthcare provider without delay.  “While Covid-19 is at the forefront of people’s minds we must remember that other health problems exist and health emergencies can occur.”   He added: “GPs are asking people to call them in the first instance and in many cases they can then carry out assessments over the phone so patients do not have to go into the surgery.   “The public must be praised for being considerate and wanting to leave our health service free to treat Covid-19 cases. However, this should not be at the expense of their own health as there is worrying evidence that people haven’t been seeking medical treatment.”	News

Gov. Cuomo Is Blaming the New York Times for His Own Coronavirus Mistakes  01 May 2020, 01:52 by Maxwell Tani  New York Governor Andrew Cuomo has an answer for critics who say the state didn’t react to the novel coronavirus quickly enough: Blame The New York Times .  Over the past several days, the governor has repeatedly used his press conferences to take shots at the self-described “Paper of Record,” lumping the publication in with other official organizations that were slow to react to the spread of COVID-19.  “Where were all the experts?” Cuomo said during a press conference earlier this week. “Where was The New York Times ? Where was The  Wall Street Journal ? Where was all the bugle blowers who should say, ‘Be careful, there’s a virus in China that may be in the United States.’”  On Thursday, the governor got more specific. When asked about his response to critics who said other states were quicker to adopt measures to curb the spread of the virus, Cuomo instead said the paper’s editorial writers should be blamed along with other organizations including the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention that supposedly did not sound the alarms early enough about the dangers of the virus.  “They didn’t write an editorial saying I should close down until after I closed down, right?” he complained.  “Where was The New York Times editorial board?” Cuomo continued moments later. “Everybody missed it. Governors don’t do global pandemics, that’s not in my job description.”  Either Cuomo didn’t actually read the Times ’ coverage, or he has selective amnesia about the paper’s articles and the recommendations in op-eds when contrasted with his own response.  Beginning in mid-January, the Times has run multiple stories daily about the spread of the virus, tracing the pandemic  from its initial outbreak in Wuhan, China, and chronicling scientists’ warnings about the disease and the first cases and deaths in many countries. Later that month, the paper was running at least half a dozen increasingly alarming items per day about the spread of the virus, particularly in Asia, and its effects on global markets.  At the time, some of the paper’s opinion columnists had a message as well: The threat of the virus is real, and scientists need to be driving policy.  In one column that ran on January 23, the same day Wuhan was sealed off from the rest of China by its government, Dr. Saad B. Omer, the director of the Yale Institute for Global Health, warned about the danger of the novel virus. He argued that politicians need to let scientists dictate policy on issues: “border screenings, travel restrictions and potential quarantine have major public health consequences, and they should be driven by science and emerging biological and epidemiological evidence.”  “We are once again faced with the outbreak of an emerging pathogen with potentially global implications,” he wrote. “We don’t know how bad it will get. But there is no excuse for not getting ready for the worst. We already know the consequences of inaction.”  In January, before there were any confirmed known cases in New York, the Times ran at least ten opinion pieces speculating about the dangers of the virus and how the U.S. should react. The editorial board itself warned about the risks of the virus on Jan. 28, saying the U.S. needed to heed the concerns of health experts. And by mid-February, the Times opinion section ran op-eds arguing how “the rapid—sometimes necessarily draconian—response of governments and health authorities has made a dent in transmission.”  In an email to The Daily Beast, the governor’s senior adviser Rich Azzopardi reiterated Cuomo’s claim that the paper’s editorial board did not call for travel bans or a shutdown order until five days after the governor put New York on “pause.”  “For all of the Monday morning quarterbacking, it’s important to acknowledge the role everyone played, and didn’t play,” he said. “No one is saying articles weren’t written on the topic generally, but the point is, no one—not the experts, not the major health organizations, not the media who covered them, even The New York Times —were sounding the alarm on the potential for thousands of cases in the New York Metropolitan area before any testing confirmed a single case.”  While there were certainly mixed messages and little outright direction from the U.S. government, New York was still slower to react than other states and countries.  Infectious disease experts and doctors urged the closing of schools for days before the state eventually announced such action (Dr. Nancy Messonnier, director of the National Center for Immunization and Respiratory Diseases said in late February that states should be prepared to close schools). The state government also dragged its feet as top health officials suggested that it was possible that many states would see stay-at-home measures. By the middle of the month, as New York attempted to mount a response to the virus, Cuomo was still feuding with New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio, declaring, “There’s not going to be any ‘you must stay in your house’ rule” (which he, in effect, reversed course on three days later when he put the state on “pause”).  And while Cuomo’s public approval rating has jumped and he has become a media darling and Democratic Party hero, in the months after the Times ’ coverage, New York state still lagged behind some of the other localities affected by the coronavirus.  Though the state’s cases were growing, New York waited until after Washington and California had adopted widespread social-distancing measures to institute similar policies. In public statements, Cuomo attempted to reassure the public by proclaiming that the virus would not hit New York as particularly hard.  “When you’re saying, what happened in other countries versus what happened here, we don’t even think it’s going to be as bad as it was in other countries,” Cuomo said in early March.  “New York City as a whole was late in social measures,” the city’s former deputy health commissioner Isaac B. Weisfuse said in a recent interview. “Any after-action review of the pandemic in New York City will focus on that issue. It has become the major issue in the transmission of the virus.”  Cuomo’s complaints about the press have not, however, reached the level of pettiness displayed daily by President Donald Trump, who continues to use the pandemic as an opportunity to complain about media coverage of his administration. As The Daily Beast reported this week , the president even encouraged his friend and unofficial adviser, Fox News host Sean Hannity, to explore legal action against the paper for its critical coverage.  And certainly Cuomo realizes the paper’s editorial board and opinion section have become easy punching bags for public figures of all political persuasions.  Over the past year several years, the paper’s op-ed section has been admonished for serious errors and bizarre editorial decisions. The Times opinion section hired and quickly fired a tech columnist who had a public friendship with a neo-Nazi. Another op-ed columnist was widely ridiculed for tweeting that an American-born Olympic ice skater was an immigrant. Climate-change skeptic Bret Stephens has repeatedly generated controversy from his perch at the Times , from peddling arguments with whiffs of race-science to attempting to get a George Washington University professor reprimanded by his bosses for mean tweets . The editorial board’s unprecedented endorsement of two Democratic presidential primary candidates (who both went on to lose without winning a single state) was also widely criticized for its lack of relevance or teeth in a crucial election year.  The Times was also far from perfect on the issue of the virus. The opinion section has published several columns downplaying the severity of the virus or suggesting that the measures pushed by top global epidemiologists were useless. But the depth of reporting on the virus on the paper’s news side, coupled with the warnings on the opinion side, do not make fair scapegoats for questions about the governor’s response to the virus.  “Public health professionals will also need to work with political leaders to make hard decisions on if or when large events should be canceled, workers should be told to telecommute, schools should change the way they operate or schools should close,” the Times opinion section warned in March, weeks before the governor put his state on “pause.”   Read more at The Daily Beast.

Liberia: AMEU Distances Itself from Assertions that Randall Dobayou Completed All His Courses, Awaits Graduation  01 May 2020, 01:37 by Lennart Dodoo    According to the University’s statement, Mr. Benjamin Everett who told FrontPageAfrica that Mr. Randall Dobayou had completed all his courses at the university, but the University in a statement disclosed that his assertions do not represent the official   MONROVIA – The African Methodist Episcopal University (AMEU) has disassociated itself from the disclosure of Mr. Benjamin G. Everett, assistant registrar for records at the university, that Mr. Randall M. Dobayou, II, has completed all his courses at the university and currently awaits graduation.     Report by Lennart Dodoo, ldodoo@frontpageafricaonline.com     While the university in a statement did not confirm or deny the information provided by Mr. Everett, it stated that he spoke in his personal capacity and he acted without the knowledge of the university.  “The AME University hereby disassociates itself from the information provided by Mr. Benjamin G. Everett to FrontPage Africa in his personal capacity as he is not the official spokesperson of the University. His action was without the knowledge and consent of the University,” a press release from the university stated.  The university added: “The AME University has launched an internal investigation into this matter and the appropriate action will be taken. The AME University wants to reassure the public, its students and stakeholders of its commitment to upholding its confidentiality policy. We remain in the “pursuit of excellence”.  During his press conference on Tuesday, Mr. Dobayou, who serves as the deputy executive director of the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) in an attempt to defend his academic credentials which has come under public scrutiny referenced the assistant registrar for records and the Dean for Admission and Records that they can attest that he has no outstanding course in AME University.    Watch Mr. Randall Dobayou’s press conference in which he defended his academic credentials   He bragged that he has obtained a letter of attestation and transcript from the university.  He claimed the Dean for Records and Admission printed out his credentials for him.  He also claimed he was given the opportunity to form part of a graduation ceremony, but he refused to do since it has been long overdue.  Mr. Dobayou was expelled from the University in 2012 for unruly behaviour on campus. He was a graduating senior by then.    “The AME University has launched an internal investigation into this matter and the appropriate action will be taken. The AME University wants to reassure the public, its students and stakeholders of its commitment to upholding its confidentiality policy. We remain in the “pursuit of excellence”.   – African Methodist Episcopal University   When contacted by FrontPageAfrica , the Assistant Registrar for Records, Mr. Benjamin G. Everett, said Mr. Dobayou completed his outstanding courses during the first semester of the current academic year, therefore, he does not have a degree yet and has not been processed for graduation.  Mr. Everett, however, said upon the completion of his final courses, he requested an attestation and transcript from the school which were given to him with the exception of his degree.  “If you saw the document he displayed, you would see that the date on it is 2020 or December 2019. It was very recent that we handed him his credentials because he just completed his courses. He does not have a degree yet. This means he has not graduated yet. He is to be part of the next graduating class,” Mr. Everett told FrontPageAfrica.  Mr. Dobayou admitted to FrontPageAfrica that the credentials given him by the university are dated 2019/2020.  This conflicting to his claim that he obtained an attestation from the University as a graduating senior in 2013 which formed part of documents he filed to obtain a U.S. visa.  His admission that academic credentials obtained from AMEU are dated 2019/2020 has also brought into question his claim that he obtained a post-graduate certificate in ventilation and refrigeration from the Vatterott Technical College in Iowa, USA.  He also claimed to have obtained a graduate certificate from the State of Iowa – National Carrier Readiness Certificate.  Displaying another certificate, he said, “This is from Esco Institute in Chicago that makes me an EPA certified universal technician. You can verify it. You have to have a university credential before enrolling,” he said.  What remains unanswered is how he enrolled for the post-graduate program without having the credentials of an undergraduate.	News

I’ll now turn it over to Bill Hornbuckle.   Bill Hornbuckle   Thank you, Aaron and good afternoon everyone. This is my first earnings call as Acting CEO of MGM Resorts, but as most of you know, I’ve been with the company for over 22 years and the industry for over 40. I’ve seen many difficult periods in that time, including the original MGM fire, 9/11, the global financial crisis, One October, but the COVID-19 pandemic is truly unprecedented. I’m proud of the disciple in focus that has defined our response to the crisis and I’m confident we are taking the necessary actions to position MGM Resorts for a sustainable recovery.  We usually start these calls with the results, but since many of you have already seen our first quarter numbers we disclosed last week, I like to address the impacts of the COVID-19 on our business, our employees and our communities and then I’ll walk you through the quarter and our longer-term outlook.  Before I do, I would like to acknowledge the stewardship of our board of directors and the partnership of our Chairman, Paul Salem of Providence Equity Partners. I’m grateful for the council as we manage through the current environment. Paul’s background provides valuable expertise and capital allocations and we work together to enhance the company’s overall return on investment.  The COVID-19 pandemic represents a tremendous challenge to the global economy, to society as a whole and of course to a company like ours, which exists to offer guests world-class entertainment and hospitality experiences. On an individual level, the suffering imposed by COVID-19 has been enormous.  Our hearts go to all of those who have lost family members, friends and colleagues. We have also lost 11 of our own at MGM. We’re all extremely grateful to the medical personnel and first responders who are serving on the front-line of the pandemic and also like to recognize the MGM employees who are reporting to work every day and are essential to keeping our properties safe and secure.  As you all know, in mid-March, we closed all of our U.S. properties. At that time, we began to take decisive measures to protect our business by maximizing liquidity and minimizing our cash out flows. In the past few weeks, we have cut our dividend, reduced our deferred nonessential spending, amended our credit agreement and raised 750 million in new bonds.  The most difficult step however was to furlough nearly 63,000 employees. This was painful and it’s a hard decision to make, but we are actively preparing for the day and we can welcome them back. As a result of these actions and our real estate transactions, MGM has 4.6 billion of cash on its balance sheet, excluding MGM China, and MGP, an estimated domestic cash outflow of approximately 270 million per month while we are closed.  During this international health crisis, we have focused on the safety of our employees and guests and in strengthening the committees in which we operate. This has been and continues to be our top priority. As such, we have committed to continue providing health benefits to our impacted employees and while difficult, this experience has again confirmed the strength of our values and our culture.  The company, our employees, and our partners collectively have raised 12.8 million for the employee emergency grant fund to provide relief for employees and immediate families in need. We’ve also given over 1 million in food and products to local communities, provided logistics for 250,000 COVID-19 test in Nevada and donated over 1 million units of PPE.  MGM China has also made significant efforts to supporting the region to the crisis, including donating MOP 20 million or approximately $2.5 million to the Hubei Province and providing other means of support, PPE or otherwise to its local community.  Although COVID-19 presents unique challenges, we are extremely well-positioned culturally, financially, and operationally to handle this crisis. Because of the strength and the actions we are now taking, we are poised to regain momentum as soon as the danger to public health lifts and we can begin to restore normal operations.  I’m going to briefly walk you through some of the key strategic questions that will play a major role in our performance going forward. Right now, we are intensely focused on but a few, how and when do we reopen and what does it mean to gather safely? While we have always put health and safety at the forefront of all that we do, they are new imperatives.  Consumer confidence is key to economic recovery and thoughtful reopening strategies are vital to building public trust. This is a responsibility that we take extremely seriously. So, let me briefly outline our thinking about the question of how we reopen. We are working through our safety plan right now and expect to make this public in the next two weeks. We know there are a number of key areas that are essential to protect the public and build confidence in our ability to put people back to work and safely welcome guests.  We are collaborating with public health officials, experts in epidemiology and biosafety and both state and federal governments to come up with a set of protocols that will help deliver a secure environment. These will include measures like physical distancing, stringent sanitation and cleanliness protocols, the provisions of PPE, crowd management, and more.  We’re also developing digital innovations for touchless interactions across the guest experience to improve protection and create greater overall confidence in the hospitality environment and their overall experience. We will continue to be driven by data, by science and by public health guidelines as we evaluate and evolve our operating practices and guest interactions. This brings us to the second question, when will we able to reopen our domestic properties.  Ultimately, the precise reopening dates depend on decisions by elected officials consulting with public health authorities. In MGM's case, that means the Governors of Nevada, New Jersey, Maryland, Michigan, Massachusetts, Mississippi, Ohio and New York. Due to various public health conditions in these States, we are preparing to open properties in phases. Given the stabilization of cases in Asia and recent comments by the Macau's Chief Executive, we anticipate this market may show meaningful recovery early this summer.  In the U.S., certain states such as Mississippi will likely open sooner than more heavily impacted states and we anticipate that regional drive markets, obviously, will rebound faster than fly-in destinations. Once Las Vegas Casinos are allowed to open we will have made decisions about property openings based on consumer demand and the economics of individual properties will also balance those needs of our employees, our local regulators, and other key stakeholders.  In all cases, we will open in a way that protects the health and safety of our guests and our employees and again I must stress that is our highest priority. Now, I’ll spend a few minutes looking back over our Q1 results. Our net income was 807 million versus 31 million in the prior period, due to 1.7 billion pre-tax gain relating to the MGM Grand and Mandalay Bay transactions.  As we previously announced, our first two months were even stronger than our internal projections, Las Vegas Strip adjusted property EBITDAR was up 27%, and our regional operations adjusted property EBITDAR was up 26% both on a same-store basis. These strong results were driven by robust organic growth and Phase 1 of MGM 2020 working in its full force.  As expected, performance deteriorated dramatically in March when we required to close all of our domestic properties. As a result, our Q1 consolidated adjusted EBITDA was down 61% to 295 million with Las Vegas down 34 and our regional down 28 and MGM China recording an EBITDA loss of 22 million.  Looking ahead, our strategic planning is being driven by three overriding goals: to simplify our operating model, maintain a commitment to strict capital discipline, and bringing intense focus on executing our current initiatives such as MGM 2020. Let me touch on a few of these areas. We are significantly reducing our operating expenses by cutting expenses across all properties and corporate departments. This is crucial to achieving long-term recovery.  We moved quickly to reduce operating costs through furloughs and freezing positions, as well as eliminating nonessential expenditures. We also initiate a program to allow senior executives and directors to receive 2020 compensation in the form of restricted stock units and while operating efficiently and effectively with an eye towards improving margins has been a core philosophy we are taking more aggressive actions to further adjust our operating model in response to the current environment.  We believe this is a very opportunistic moment in time to operate and to take a look at all things that we’ve been doing historically. We’re carefully also managing our cash to protect the company's financial position. We have deferred, reduced our expected 2020 domestic capital expenditures by at least 50% or approximately 200 million. We have announced that the board reduced our dividend to $0.01 per share annually resulting in quarterly savings of approximately 73 million and importantly we will continue to meet our rental obligations to MGP and Blackstone.  We also have strengthened our liquidity position in addition to the 4.6 billion of cash on our domestic balance sheet today and adjusted for the bond offering, MGP has also agreed to redeem 1.4 billion of our OP units in cash should we elect to have them redeemed. We have additional liquidity levers including our remaining stake in MGP, our 50% stake in CityCenter and the ROFO asset MGM China.  We also have a 56% stake in MGM China although to be clear, we want to continue to and – we continue to believe in the future of Macau and look forward to continuing to invest in our presence there. We have no debt maturing prior to 2022 and just yesterday closed on our credit agreement and then providing additional flexibility on our financial covenants.  MGM China is also well-positioned with our 800 million of liquidity and earlier this month it further amended its credit agreement to provide for additional financial covenant relief as well. MGP has also drawn down on its revolver for additional liquidity. We are also continuing to advance our long-term strategic initiatives. We will drive progress in MGM 2020 by continuing to reduce expenses and pursue capital projects that will allow for higher margins and returns once our business fully recovers.  We will continue to execute on our real estate strategy over time and we continue to invest in growth opportunities such as Japan, Macau, sports betting and online gaming. And in particular, I want to emphasize we remain fully committed to our partnership with Oryx to develop a world-class integrated resort in Osaka.  Let me spend about a moment on Macau. I was recently elected to be Chairman of MGM China alongside Pansy Ho as Co-Chair. I am personally just as excited today about Macau as I was 20 years ago when I first visited. We believe the market will rebound rapidly with the Visa scheme and other restriction, once other restrictions on loosened. MGM's China – our properties are currently incurring cash operating expenses of approximately 1.5 million per day, which is an excessive amount being earned obviously by those properties.  While we are currently focused on managing the current situation in driving efficiencies within our current footprint, we will continue to invest in our properties and expand our offerings, especially on non-gaming with more sweets and more room product. I look forward to working with the new Chief Executive in Macau and this administration and to support the strategies for further development in Macau.  In summary, we remain confident in the long-term outlook of our business with a strong start of the year, which was encouraging and points to the success of a number of initiatives such as MGM 2020 that we had recently implemented. In Las Vegas, our margins were back over 30%. We have leading assets in most of our markets, which will further support a healthy recover to our business. We will continue to simplify the way we operate and we focus resources into areas that create the most value for our shareholders.  On a more personal note to wrap up, as someone with four decades of experience in this industry, I’m honored for the opportunity to lead a great company like MGM Resorts. The efforts I’ve outlined today speak to my intent of being clear and focused by being disciplined in all things and to striving to be transparent in my leadership of this organization.  Hopefully, they will become the hallmarks of what I want to stand for and what this company stands for going forward. While there is no proven playbook for the current challenges we face, I have faith in our deep operating experience, our expertise in safely managing public gatherings, the strength of our long-term plan, and our tenure in this business.  And more than that, I have a tremendous amount of confidence that the men and women of MGM Resorts and our partners around the world will rise to this challenge as they have on so many occasions before. I look forward to the day soon, and we will say, once again let’s entertain the world.  Thank you, and with that I’ll open it up for questions.   Question-and-Answer Session    Operator   Thank you. [Operator Instructions] And our first question today will come from Joe Greff with JPMorgan. Please go ahead.   Joe Greff   Good afternoon everybody. Good afternoon Bill. I was going to start of Bill with you and ask specifically you what you might be doing differently then say Jim did in his tenure, but I kind of thought you laid it out pretty eloquently. So, I will not take that as one of my two questions. So, starting with question number one, and I know you talked about it, it’s premature to talk about the timing of when you can reopen your domestic properties, and so, just – just maybe can you talk about how you think about how you will start to phase in properties particularly on the Las Vegas Strip? I think before maybe on CNBC, you said that maybe you would start with properties that are not on – that at the higher price point like Excalibur, nor would it be those properties have traditionally hosted a large percentage of international visitors. If the Las Vegas Strip opens for the summer how many properties by the end of this year realistically optimally do you anticipate could be opened by the end of this year? How many by the middle of next year, you know how much of your views will be in reaction to airline capacity coming back? And how much of it is depended on the group business?   Bill Hornbuckle   Thank you, Joe. I appreciate backing of the first question and focusing on a simple one. So, let me – I have got to this maybe in three buckets and obviously Corey can and will chime in here. Macau speaks for itself and Grant is on the phone to the extent at the end of this you want to ask some additional questions, but we are hopeful that early this summer given all the indicators and things we see in China that that market will begin to open up.  Guangdong province of note, which is critical to us is feeling better, although it goes back and forth as you know, but the order of magnitude of case loads there are significantly down, and we feel better about what’s happening and we think there is some opportunity there in early summer. The regional properties obviously like I said in my prepared comments are going to be – as all of these places are going to be predicated on what the government says.  What Governors are saying is at least the baseline mandate and our regulators. We do see Mississippi first, obviously we see places like Empire potentially off to later in the year, time to be determined. The good news about our regionals is their drive markets with the exception of BAW, which does have some fly capacity given the 800 keys there and the programs that we run, but we see those potentially Mississippi, potentially Maryland down the road of note and then those begin to rollout.  You’ve all seen what’s going on Michigan, so obviously we’re in the midst of all of that in Detroit. So, we will take one step at a time. More specific to your question in Las Vegas we have of you and don't know exactly when, the Governor has been speaking almost daily now on when to open. He like most governors is looking at a three-phased process trying to open up small businesses things like golf courses et cetera, understand what happens in those – with the community in that respect. Then go to the next bucket.  In some areas, we are in that next bucket, Nevada of note, and in some areas potentially like Maryland we may be in the third bucket of activity, but in there it’s believed that gaming will open universally meaning all of gaming in Southern Nevada will have a chance to open same time when it’s deemed safe. Again, we just don't know. We’re probably looking at two or three offerings initially.  Obviously, something of a value set. We tend to lean into New York. New York because it’s one of our simpler places to run, it’s 2000 rooms. We’re probably looking at Bellagio at the other end. I'm wanting to ensure, I'm sure the competitors set down the street is going to open because they only have one in the context of when in sands. So, want to be in the high-end business. And then from there we’re talking about what other properties should open if any at that point in time and, you know we’ll go slow, we will be responsive and responsible, we will look to the economics in some of it.  Most of these properties need to be between 30% and 50% to generate any kind of cash that is meaningful i.e. meaning not going backwards from being closed. And so we're going to see how the market responds. You did mention the airlines; we were in a conversation last week with Southwest, its President and remaining of its leadership team. They are still bullish on Las Vegas. The interesting thing I think is the point-to-point carriers will come first. And obviously the hub guys, the United, the Americans, the Deltas in the world have other challenges with hubs that may restrict some activity here, but Southwest feels relatively bullish. They won't start here first, but I think over time you’ll see them focus on this market because as always in these circumstances, Las Vegas presents a great deal of value. Corey, if you want to?   Corey Sanders   I think you hit all the key points Bill. I mean, obviously safety is a key thing. We want to avoid any spikes and numbers and things like that. So, we will deal with it cautiously and in general a lot of it will be demand driven. Just as a reminder, about 50% of the traffic coming into Las Vegas is from automobiles, and we do think there will be some pent up demand and as the opportunity comes about, we’ll definitely open up properties to maximize our cash flow.   Bill Hornbuckle   Grant, anything to add on Macau? Grant?   Grant Bowie   I think, Bill, I just reiterate again. Bill, thank you. I guess the challenge is that it's about opening up, as you've seen. The critical point for us is that, we expect that the volumes of traffic will be significantly restricted. We see that as actually somewhat of a positive, because by and large we think that the premium market will come back first. That's obviously where we have that strength and that's what we're looking to.  I think everybody probably also heard that Hong Kong has extended their quarantining requirements through June 7, that we do hope that within that time that there might be some adjustments with China and we're waiting just to get that information. So, we're very positive. We're very comfortable that we're trying to manage as best we can, but most importantly, from our discussions with their customers, the demands there, the opportunity for them to travel is the only thing they're looking for. Thank you.   Joe Greff   Great. That was my question to you Grant. You answer it. Thank you very much, guys.   Bill Hornbuckle   Thanks, Joe.   Grant Bowie   Thank you.   Operator   Next question comes from Carlo Santarelli with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.   Carlo Santarelli   Hi, Bill. Thank you for taking my question.   Bill Hornbuckle   Hi, Carlo.   Carlo Santarelli   So, guys – you guys have spent the last several quarters, years actually kind of putting together a top down framework of how to run the business more efficiently and whatnot. One of the questions I had was, as you sit from that perspective now, having consolidated your expense rationale and thinking along those lines, how much does that help you in an environment like this, where you're almost starting from a very low baseline firm expenses and the ability to kind of bring those expenses back on in a more kind of demand driven way?   Bill Hornbuckle   Yes. I'll kick it off and Corey. Look, I think it's been immensely valuable. If you recall, we actually started in 2016 with what do we call it, Corey? PGP, obviously, 2020, I became Chief Operating Officer last March or something along that lines. And so our ability to understand, at – frankly, at most every level, whether it was corporate, centers of excellence, or the various properties, regions, how we were operating, what the things we were doing, why we were doing and what was really bringing value, we have a very clear lens on.  And so now as we think about re-launching in a post-COVID environment and the ramp it's going to take, we have another lens into that in terms of how we're going to structure the organization, and we have some work to do there, but we believe when it's all said and done, and we return back to a normal state, we're going to be a much more efficient organization focused on those things that are priority, those things that truly matter to driving the day-to-day customer experience in our business in all the places that we serve.   Corey Sanders   What I would add Carlo is, MGM 2020 really is less than a year old. And as we stood up the COEs and centralized components of it, we've evolved since then. This closing has allowed us to really rethink that. And we think there's opportunities to become even more efficient. The other thing that MGM 2020 give us the discipline on is on our variable labor and staffing to business volume. So, we've become very disciplined, which is helping out tremendously in a time like this.   Carlo Santarelli   Great. Thank you, guys. And then if I could just one follow-up. Bill, you mentioned it earlier, obviously, that the $1.4 billion that's kind of available to you there. Clearly, with the balance sheet as its structured today and the more nimble paradigm that you guys are in that there is plenty of kind of runway with respect to liquidity. Is the decision to kind of pull the string on that $1.4 billion more dependent on how this situation evolves six, nine months down the road? Or would you be advantageous in the event that you saw the valuation of that thought or fairly reflect kind of what you and myself included, think it’s worth?   Corey Sanders   Carlo, it’s Corey. I'll take that. Look, I think the – based on the agreement we have with MGP, we really do have a long-dated option. We, as you mentioned, I think we feel really good about our liquidity position and it does give us – especially what we did last week, it gives us the ability to not be in any big rush. When – we'll transact when we believe it's the right time to transact and the right point and would whatever is the most efficient manner in it for us. So, and just as a reminder, MGP is a pretty important stock for us. We have over $5 billion of value in MGP.   Carlo Santarelli   Understood. Thank you, guys.   Bill Hornbuckle   Thank you, Carlo.   Operator   The next question comes from Stephen Grambling with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.   Stephen Grambling   Thanks. I think in the opening remarks you mentioned still being committed to Japan. Can you just provide an update on the milestones investors should be watching? How the investment timing and size may have evolved? Any color unexpected returns?   Bill Hornbuckle   Sure. What Japan like most places in the world is being impacted by COVID-19, it – I think literally as early as today, you may see Abe stick additional restrictions up to another 30 days is what has been rumored to be discussed. I think the impact of that is, it will slow down, although, we are not definitively sure the RFP process as it currently sits in Osaka and we are ready for this. By the way, we have an RFP submission that is due end of July.  Our team has worked hard on this, as you know, we’re the lone standing applicant there, and we would submit, but I think what may happen is that the whole process gets pushed closer to the end of the year, which I think is appropriate and fine by us. In terms of its scale, you see – in terms of other opportunities in Japan, Yokohama has expressed sincere interest is now working its way through its own process and time to tell whether others actually joined. We still see Asia as a huge build and is a huge upside for the company, and frankly, for the industry.  We're very bullish on Macau in the long run and we're absolutely bullish on Japan in the long run. You're still zone $10 billion investment. And the returns on that to be determined once we get through all the regs. But they're significant and they would be significant to the company in its overall portfolio and how we balance our earnings as we look at everything that we have. And so, we remain bullish. I think it will get delayed and we're ready if it does not is really, I guess, my final point.   Stephen Grambling   Great, thanks. And then my follow-up is related to Joe's earlier question. You had mentioned occupancies needing to be around, I think, it was 30% to 50% and generate meaningful cash flow. Given the model has typically been run with very high occupancies on the strip, what are the biggest bottlenecks that you can tackle to help alleviate crowds, increase distance and maximize that cash flow as you think about different parts of either the property or the segment in business? Thanks?   Bill Hornbuckle   Yes. There's – and Corey help me with this. There's a couple different aspects to it. Obviously, getting air back and getting large group gatherings are critical to the ultimate and final recovery. We do believe because of drive-in traffic, which particularly spikes in the summer, that regionally we will see a substantial amount of drive-in. I mean, there's obviously pent-up demand.  You saw what happened in the beaches of California when they open for a weekend. I think they're going to close again, which is not what we want to do to be clear. But I think you'll see leisure demand. I think, you'll see drive traffic, and it'll push what happens from that perspective. The casino has always been active. Our offer set that remains out there, people are still booking into the balance of this year and into next already. They're anxious. They have pent-up demand as well here and in Macau. They want to come back.  And so irrespective of large-scale events, I think, championship fight hosted with 15,000 people, the Casino segment is anxious to come back. Group, obviously, will be the last. I would tell you this on group as a way to think about it. We have lost a little less than half of our group business because of the pandemic. Half of that has already rebooked over the next 12 months. And so if you think about it in macro, we're down about 25%, but the really encouraging thing there is that large group formats and particularly for our company tech business has come back.  And so, there's not a change of mindset around how people will come and gather into the future from the Microsoft's of the world who want to come back to this market and do it in a meaningful way. So, we're encouraged by that longer-term. And then ultimately, obviously, we have a partnership with AEG. We do a lot with Live Nation. Getting back major events is really going to get down to the protocols that requires to host an event of that scale and time. I think that simply is going to probably be the last to cure and to heal. Corey, you want to talk maybe the environment inside and the cost?   Corey Sanders   I think, in general, we're going to be following a lot of protocols like many of our competitors are. We’ll have the supplies, the gear we'll need, the distancing we'll need, we're sizing that up right now on what that would mean is, how we open in all the jurisdictions. We should have a fairly good idea of that by the next time we talk.  The other area, I think where we're going to probably see some decent play, especially in Las Vegas at a property like Bellagio, or any of our high-end is the high-end casino customer. As Bill mentioned, we have been in contact with them and they were the last to leave when we closed down. I have a feeling some of them will be back the day we open. So, that's positive, but I think the key for us to get our margins back up will be as that group business returns in what's strange is we still have quite a few rooms on the books for the back-half of the year.  And as Bill mentioned, booking for next year has been very strong. And in particular, in comparing it to where we were at the same time last year looking at 2019 and 2018, which is more apples-to-apples, which was our best year, by the way, in convention room nights. We have more rooms on the books now for 2021 than we do – we did for 2019 at the same time in 2018.   Stephen Grambling   Great. Thank you so much.   Operator   The next question comes from Thomas Allen with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.   Thomas Allen   Hi, Corey, respecting your last comments, you're still working through this. I'm just trying to figure out, when you do reopen these properties and they're going to be clear social distancing measures, like having to keep a space between slot machines, like, can you just give us a rough sense of like, what kind of percentage of positions you can get back online versus history? Will it be 30%, 50%, 70%, any rough sense in kind of the difference between Vegas and regional?   Corey Sanders   We're still working on those numbers. We'll be able to give you some good ideas. I could tell you the regionals that will have more of an impact. The floors in Las Vegas were built 10, 15 years ago. And this is our chance to probably right size them with the proper distancing and positioning. The regionals will take a little bit more effort, and we'll be able to talk more about it in the next quarter.   Bill Hornbuckle   And Tom, at Park, MGM and at ARIA, we're – actually, we’re putting down in particularly two of those places, new casino carpet, now is a good time to do it. And so we're reconfiguring those floors with the space in mind for distancing. And so, the environment will feel a little different when people walk in from day one.   Corey Sanders   And the only other thing I would add is, some of these jurisdictions might have limits to number of people in the building. And if that would be the case, our floor format would be adjusted for that.   Thomas Allen   Helpful. Thank you. And then, look, this may be a long shot, but you're in a lot better liquidity position than some of your peers, have you given any thought about going on the offense?   Bill Hornbuckle   It’s Bill. Yes, we've given, of course, you always give a thought. But look, we're going to stay very focused. We don't know how long this is going to take. We like the projects that ultimately, if we come out of this, we've defined sports betting, hopefully, an extension of a license and continuation in Macau, in Japan, very – on principle. You never say, never; but that's not going to be our focus.  And again, not knowing how long all of this takes and what it does do to our balance sheet look, right now, it's strong. We're up and operating and be stronger than it's ever been, I think, in the history of the company and many, many decades anyways. And so, we are fortunate in that respect, but again, we just don't know.   Thomas Allen   Helpful. Thank you.  Operator  The next question will be from Shaun Kelley with Bank of America. Please go ahead.   Shaun Kelley   Hi, good afternoon. Hi, Bill.   Bill Hornbuckle   Hi, Shaun.   Shaun Kelley   Just wanted to – you have a unique position on some of these larger scale group events, and Bill, I know you spent a lot of time in your – in some of your prior roles and some of these bigger sports relationships and whatnot. Just kind of any insights may be there? I mean, obviously, you said the group piece, which isn't good anymore maybe convention, they take time to come back, but what are your thoughts specifically on some of the event like things? So, let's call it sports and some of the key entertainment pieces here. Just what are you hearing? What are some of those vendors and the Live Nation of the world is saying at the moment? Could you just give us a little bit more color there? Because I think this is important to so many people...   Bill Hornbuckle   Yes. I mean, obviously, this is coming from our perspective. So, I don't want speak for Live Nation or AEG, but I would say this. As it relates to first entertainment here, we have a mindset that we will open some of our smaller showrooms and I'll give a simple example like Carrot Top or something that's small and intimate with a one person show can be open and relatively simplistically, we can provide the proper protections, et cetera. Obviously, that begins to scale a little bit differently when you get to Cirque and then when you get to the big events, on the convention side, it's not easy, but remember, we're fortunate we have 3.5 million square feet of space in Las Vegas.  And so our ability to stretch things out more than most, if not all, is unique. And so we can host an event. And yes, it will be a bit of a space pig, but at least we'll be able to host the event. And so we can set up as we have with various meeting planners and already organizations, different protocols to how to do that. Until we get all the health and safety protocols, we're not going to be definitive, but we do have that unique capacity.  As it relates to sports and obviously, for us and you remember how we were talking about this before this started with the Raiders what we've seen with hockey, long-term Las Vegas will recover. Long-term, the Raiders stadium is in our backyard, but we may see a few games this year with our people.  A simple example, we were creating a large pre-game environment outside of Mandalay and Luxor, which can be pretty special, you walk over to the bridge and go to the game to be able to come back tailgate party. We put that on hold, because it's our general view that if it were fortunate enough to see real fans, it won't be 65,000. And so we'll probably see stuff like that spring.  We have been an ongoing dialogue with leagues and other sporting activities around televised-only events, I think boxing, MMA, NBA, NHL, et cetera, and we can host some of that. We are working diligently with those to do that, but I think the idea that we're going to get 15,000 people in T-Mobile for a concert anytime this year is probably a stretch.   Shaun Kelley   That's helpful. And then as my follow-up, and this one is a little bit technical, so my apologies, but just, I think in the covenant waiver that came through yesterday on some of the MGP shares were pledged as collateral for the credit facility. And so I was just wondering if you could elaborate on what kind of restrictions that means for either the OP unit repurchase or specifically, maybe the ability to sell down MGP shares in the future?   Corey Sanders   Yes. Shaun, it’s Corey. Yes, we did agree to pledge our OP units as collateral under our revolver credit facility. We did not agree to any restrictions on our ability to monetize the units, though, so for cash. So, we are not limited in our ability to pursue, for example, the cash redemption of up to $1.4 billion or future other sales.  There – in the amendment, it does provide that if we sell units under a certain level of falling below 30%, then incremental proceeds would have to be used to reduce the commitments as long as we're in this waiver period.   Shaun Kelley   Great. Thanks for that, Corey.   Operator   The next question will come from Harry Curtis with Instinet. Please go ahead.   Harry Curtis   Hi, Bill. I wanted to ask a question about CapEx first. And now that you've been in the CEO chair for such a long period…   Bill Hornbuckle   Thanks, Harry.   Harry Curtis   … as you look at CapEx not in the next 6 or 12 months, but how do you feel or maybe prioritize CapEx projects globally and their potential returns once your core business settles down? What are the best opportunities? And maybe Grant can chime in on this as well.   Bill Hornbuckle   Maybe a general overview and then Corey and Grant can clearly clean up. Look, we've seen that we've reduced our CapEx, I think, I mentioned in my pre opening remarks in half this year. There are things that are going to be essential to maintain the stores in the condition that we think they ought to be simple things like room remodels, Bellagio and others that will be just – going to be ongoing maintenance costs, and things that we're going to want to do.  We will become more disciplined on some of the projects. We will become more focused on what's to be accomplished and why with a real mindset for margin around it in terms of just the day-to-day CapEx stuff. Domestically, with maybe the exception of New York, I think our primary focus is going to be Asia.  And so, to the extent, we can work our way through a license in Macau and a renewal, which we're very hopeful for. And think, frankly, all this activity around COVID-19, Grant and the team have done a magnificent job putting us in good stead there with the government, but time to tell, that would be a large priority. And then ultimately, for us, it's still all about Asia and it's Japan.  Japan represents without a doubt, the chance to move the needle. I mean, we're talking about something that would generate EBITDA in the 20-odd percent range to boost our company and put Asia at roughly a 50% EBITDA percentage in terms of our total EBITDA. So, we're focused on that.   Corey Sanders   To Bill's point, everything – our main focus, especially on growth will be increasing our return on investment. Domestically, as Bill mentioned, outside of New York, the digital technology components have become big. And I think, as we open up in this environment, you'll start seeing benefits from that. And we still think there's a future there. Grant, I don't know if you want to talk a little bit about Asia.   Grant Bowie   I think the critical issue, I'll just repeat what I've – what we've said previously. We've got the south suites coming on, and that's really important. More accommodation for us is really important. In terms of the existing capital allocation we have, we've critically reviewed all those items and we're actually pulling back on ones, because what we also want to be prepared is, we want to have some money left in the kitty. We don't want to spend for the sake of spending.  So, we're actually taking monies we would have allocated and then identified when we reopened. There may be some adjustments we need to make, maybe some food and beverage things. So, rather than spending and then having to come back and do it again, we're pulling back.  Reiterating what Bill said as well, the focus for all of us is all about the concession renewal. And we have significant plans that we've discussed earlier about opportunities to develop, but we also need to be mindful what the expectations of the Chief Executive are. And he is – he does have different views. And what we're excited about is – and we're putting aside funds that we will be in a position to obviously respond to the diversification strategies that he is putting forward.   Bill Hornbuckle   And then, Harry, it's not huge capital dollars in respect to some of the other things we're talking about, but sports betting, iGaming is a real opportunity. I was just reading this morning, Morgan Stanley's piece. I think the market is $8.5 billion – $10 billion, whatever it is it's becoming real.  In New Jersey, this month alone, if we paced out what we did the last couple of weeks in iGaming, it's $100 million business for us. Pennsylvania is around the corner, Michigan is around the corner….   Corey Sanders   Colorado.   Bill Hornbuckle   …and Colorado is around the corner. And given what's happening in states because of the stress of COVID, we think that'll open sooner than later. And well not extensive capital dollars, it does run in the hundreds of – a couple hundred million potentially before we turn the corner and really make something of this, but it is without a doubt, I think, one of the things that's not been unlocked in our value and our valuation, but it can and it will be over time.   Harry Curtis   I appreciate that. And maybe one more for Grant, and this is a very broad leading question, but can you do enough to satisfy the Chief Executive? I'll leave it at that.   Grant Bowie   I think clearly, all concessionaires that are in Macau, I think, are well positioned and clearly, we will do what's necessary. Bill has made it very clear. This is the focus of the company. We're very confident. We're very positive. I think the simple thing, as I keep saying is, we just have to do – keep doing the things we're doing better. We need to do the right thing by the people. We need to do everything well.  I think during this difficult time, I think, ourselves and all the concessionaires have demonstrated our true commitment to Macau, the people of Macau and the future of Macau. And I think that's just how we need to always focus on. One day at a time, it's not a single guy decision. It's all about a cumulative effort. And that's what we're good at. We're building confidence. We’re building respect and then hopefully for us, the rewards will flow.   Harry Curtis   Thanks. Thanks, Grant and Bill.   Bill Hornbuckle   Thanks, sir.   Operator   The next question comes from Felicia Hendrix with Barclays. Please go ahead.   Felicia Hendrix   Hi, thanks so much. So Bill, there's a – there are buyers of assets out there, you have Las Vegas stands to talk about M&A. We've seen news, Blackstone, you know acknowledging that you might not make the kind of decision now, would you be open to selling further assets?   Bill Hornbuckle   It's not immediately on the horizon. You would always be open to selling assets, I suspect, but it's not something that we've got in our strategic plan. We have obviously the ROFO in Springfield, which is an opportunity. We're looking to acquire over time, the other side of city center, not go that way, but given where we are today, we've got a lot in front of us.   Grant Bowie   Look, I think we're in a really good position, and I don't think we could get the value that we got for Bellagio or MGM today.   Bill Hornbuckle   Yes.   Grant Bowie   So we'll build that business back up. And if there's an opportune time, we'll look at for that.   Felicia Hendrix   Okay, thanks. And just Grant, you had talked about the quarantine in Guangdong and just kind of watching that as we all are, just adding Hong Kong into that picture, how are you thinking about Hong Kong and the ability to travel to and from there? And how important is that to your thoughts about recovery in Macau?   Grant Bowie   Well, I think it's pretty clear that Hong Kong, Macau, and Guangdong, the Greater Bay Area, are all in inextricably linked. We already know that the quarantining requirements in Hong Kong will not be lifted until the 7th of June at the earliest. Hong Kong is always an important feeder market. Even many of our customers coming in from China come via Hong Kong as you know, but on the other side of it, there is a possibility, and we obviously sitting here hoping that's happening and the Chief Executive even acknowledged that he is in dialogue with Guangdong to see if they cannot be some relaxation or some progressive opening up of the Zhuhai China border.  So, we know the Hong Kong date for review. We're still positive and somewhat expected that we may see some opportunities coming up in May for China, and it'll be multi-step. The first will be the removal of the return to China quarantining and then the ultimate objective that we see coming out in the next weeks and months is the releasing of the IDF system. And that's really the critical point for us once the obvious comes back.  So Felicia, I'm sorry, I don't have the specific timings. Those are the steps. As I said earlier, talking to the customers, they're positive, they're confident, all of us are just sitting here waiting to make sure that it's safe to travel. They're confident that we can take care of them. I think we've been very good at communicating that. So it's – we're ready to go. And frankly, after all this time, we're very anxious to get started as you can imagine.   Felicia Hendrix   Yes. Okay. Thank you.   Operator   The next question will come from John Decree with Union Gaming. Please go ahead.   John Decree   Hi, everyone, thanks for taking my question and all the details so far. Just one for me maybe for Corey. Last slide in your deck you talked about the CARES Act and some of the possible benefits there related to payroll tax and carry back. I was wondering if you could give us some insight as to what that might – what that quantum might be if you've kind of sized that up. Is it meaningful for you, it might be a little too early some of those carry backs, but I just wanted to get your initial thoughts on what that means for your company?   Bill Hornbuckle   Yes. I'll go through each one and I'm not sure I could quantify them all, because not knowing where our numbers are going to be that would be dependent on that, but obviously, the refund of the federal income tax five-year carry back that will play on our 2020 return, which we'll file in 2021. That will be a pretty good number from based on where our projections are.  We haven't quantified it yet, but we'll – hopefully, over the next few months, we'll be able to. On the interest expense deduction limitation for income tax benefits, we also expect to see a little bit benefit of that in 2021, but more in 2022 since we’ll be carrying back most of our loss.  There's actually two payroll provisions. One is actually on the payment of furlough in health benefits. We will receive a 50% deduction on that component. Those regulations are getting written right now. We had a pretty significant payment that we will receive that credit. Actually right now, we're receiving it.  And then finally, there's the deferral of the FICA tax of the employer portion, any of those payments would be deferred to 2021 and 2022. So, we haven't quantified the amount yet over the next few months. We'll try to put some numbers around that and get that out there.   John Decree   That's helpful. I appreciate the color, Corey. Thank you.   Unidentified Company Representative   And we'll take the last question, please.   Operator   Sure. The last question will be from David Katz from Jefferies. Please go ahead.   David Katz   Last. Thank you for taking my question. I – seriously, I appreciate it and all of the detail. Look, I – there's a bit of dissonance that I was hoping you could talk a bit more about, because you have talked about the efforts to size the business appropriately where ongoing pre-crisis that are still ongoing and they change. At the same time, reopening may bear some incremental costs as well. Have you had a moment to sort of lay those side-by-side? And ultimately, I suppose the thrust of my question is, which one is bigger? Does it come out to be net positive at the end of the day? Is that what you're ultimately hoping to solve for?   Bill Hornbuckle   Let me kick it off, and then Corey can clearly clean it up. Yes, the answer is, of course, it wants to be net positive. There are going to be given the protocols that we've talked about, whether they're cleaning or otherwise some additional costs, but I would offset it with a simple idea and a notion. Protocol to clean a room in this environment is going to be extensive. And therefore, you could argue that the efficiency around room credits will have to be altered.  I would argue the other side of that, which would simply say, if I'm a guest in Bellagio, I want to know that my room is pristine when I go in. And during my stay, unless I want and need clean towels, I'm probably not going to let a guestroom attendant or any other service personnel in my room. And so I think you'll see a varying degree of offsets, things like restaurants, even though we're talking about opening Bellagio potentially first, it won't be full service, all restaurants, there will be some, there'll be pick up, pick and go, if you will, for pick up opportunities for food and beverage.  And so, we're going to take the current state in mind until we get through all of the health protocols, it's a bit difficult. And that's why I said two weeks in my prepared comments, but we will be by then to then put in Corey and his team are working diligently around some of the costs. We definitely think they offset kind of the moves we're talking about in terms of structure, but, Corey, maybe you could …   Corey Sanders   Yes. What I would say, David, is we do have a decent understanding of what those costs are going to be. We think we'll end up on the better side of that. And by the way, we open the properties and ramp them. We will be able to manage component of that. And more in particular, we should – we think we should be able to offset most of these costs at fairly low occupancies. So, as we open properties and determine that, that will be – the demand for the town will be a big component of that.   Aaron Fischer   Yes, David, it’s Aaron. Just to clarify something. So, obviously, we're not giving disclosures in terms of our break-even points, but naturally, we recognize that our occupancy and utilization rates are going to be lower as we ramp up. So, what we're aiming to do through the cost-cutting is lower our break-even points.   David Katz   Got it. Thank you very much. I appreciate it.   Bill Hornbuckle   Okay. Maybe if I could just offer up a couple of closing thoughts and I appreciate everyone's time today. First and foremost, for me and the company, getting these properties up and operating, doing it in a safe manner, both for our employees and our guests is priority one. I think, again, we're ideally positioned to do that. We understand the environment. Well, we understand the organization well. And candidly, we feel the responsibility, particularly here in Southern Nevada.  Our industry to this state is the most important industry in any state in the country, more than autos are to Michigan, more than tech is to California. And we are the largest tax payer and largest employer in the state. So, I can assure you we are keenly focused on wanting to reopen, but we will only do it safely.  We are going to be a better more efficient organization moving forward, you have our commitment on that and mine. We know how to do this and we will do this and we'll make this as effective as it can be. Obviously, as we roll out, there are going to be things that we've never experienced before. So, we'll have some ups and downs, but I can assure you collectively, we’ll end up with a more efficient organization when we fully come out of the other side of this thing.  Despite all of it, we are not going to lose track of our long-term strategic initiatives. We are keenly focused, particularly on Sports and iGaming in this timeframe. There is real money, particularly in iGaming today, and Sports will begin to unfold this fall and hopefully sooner. And our real estate strategies in creating yet again, a fortress balance sheet are critical.  The notion of asset-light moving forward is critical. And ultimately, my goal, my desire, my push and I know it's shared by our Board is to be ever present and larger and more meaningfully involved in Asia, both in Macau and hopefully in Japan if we're fortunate enough to win a license there. So, I thank you for your time. Everyone be safe and be well. And I look forward to talking to you again next trip. Thank you.   Operator   And thank you, sir. The conference has now concluded. Thank you for attending today's presentation. You may now disconnect.	News
"Diving into a Hawaiian family affair with miracle ingredients  01 May 2020, 06:00 by Helen Elliott   FICTION    Sharks in the Time of Saviours    Kawai Strong Washburn   Hamish Hamilton, $32.99   Everyone knows Pearl Harbour. The last, and first, Hawaiian novel I read was James A. Michener’s Hawaii . It was published in 1959, the same year Hawaii became the 50th US state. I read it not long after and as far as I can remember it was about missionary activity. Then in the 1960s, there was the television show Hawaiian Eye , set in Honolulu but apeing 77 Sunset Strip . And later Hawaii Five-0 .  This century I learned that Barack Obama had been born in Hawaii and a few years ago I saw The Descendants , the film of a respected novel that raised issues of white/black inheritance. So I am bringing to this novel a sketchy mind. You could say a base of ignorance. Keep that in mind.    Kawai Strong Washburn has that elusive note that readers like.   Kawai Strong Washburn lives in Minneapolis but was born and raised in Hawaii. His short stories and essays have appeared in prestigious magazines and this is his first novel. He doesn’t flinch in the face of technical difficulties of writing about a family in sliding time and different voices, although he is not always successful.  At the centre of the story is the death of a child and sibling and the ramifications of this grief. It opens with Malia’s story in 1995, recounting the moment when the lives of the family, parents and three children, changed. Seven-year-old Nainoa falls over the side of a pleasure boat. His mother, Malia, dives in after him but she sees four sharks, ""their fins punched the surface, knives on the summit of dark swells, cutting for you"".  They dive, she expects to see a blood-red sea. Moments later the entire boat witnesses some sort of miracle. Nainoa is brought to the surface in the mouth of a shark: ""It was holding you like you were made of glass, like you were its child."" Nainoa has been saved by the gods of the sea, and the sea is everything to the Hawaiians.     But who will save Nainoa from the expectations of his family and his people after such an event? Even the carefree Malia starts to believe. Not in a Christian god that the missionaries have been bringing for fewer than 200 years but in something more archaic.  Nainoa is some sort of prodigy. His ""brain vaulting me past my classmates"", he also works hard, plays the ukelele like a demon, and tries to be a good son and brother. The people in the town are in awe of him and believe that he can cure them of illness, no matter how dire. His parents, stalked by poverty, cash in on their miracle son and start to earn a good living by charging for his powers.  Nainoa is the precious centre of the family, especially in the eyes of his parents. All good things come from him. His brother and sister find themselves loved but sidelined as they listen to the teachers and parents rapture about their brother. Sidelined as much by poverty and ignorance as anything else, Nainoa’s siblings can’t thrive. Washburn details, too minutely, the derangement that occurs when one child is singled out to be the saviour of a family.  There is a lot of noise about this novel and Washburn does, indeed, have that elusive note that readers long to hear. He also brings it right up to the reader, no concession with patois, geographical assumptions, mythical or cultural. He writes from a culture, about a culture that couldn’t be any more different from those old white romanticising travel stories about Hawaii. The story that binds the novel is the ancient story, familiar to all cultures and times, about sibling rivalry but it’s the setting, the land itself dark with the gods and monsters that is, perhaps, of fresh interest.  Washburn is also very acute about the bewildering life young people face when they leave home to get an education and the chasm between their family, their intimate history and the perilous new world of America. Hawaii might claim to be America but the novel lays out the superficiality of the Americanisation of Hawaii.  This is not Michener, writing from the outside, valiantly peering in, but a novel written from the inside. So it is difficult – at times – for the outside, interested reader. No more travel brochure colours, no more leis and hula dancing, no more televsionland Hawaii. Washburn’s intention is to shake us up to a very specialised version of America, unexpurgated as it is unexpected."	NotNews
Nato withholds key information on Taliban attacks, claims watchdog   01 May 2020, 06:18   KABUL, May 1 — Nato's US-led mission in Afghanistan is withholding key information about Taliban attacks, a US government watchdog said today, potentially making insights into the war harder just as the Pentagon slashes its troop presence.  The Resolute Support (RS) mission previously disclosed data on “enemy-initiated attacks,” one of the few remaining public metrics of the conflict and the strength of the Taliban and other insurgent groups.  In its quarterly report released today, the office of the Special Inspector General for Afghanistan Reconstruction (Sigar) said RS had stopped providing numbers.  Instead, RS gave only a short statement noting the Taliban stepped up attacks in March, immediately after the signing of a US-Taliban deal that was supposed to pave the way to peace talks.  “Between March 1 and 31, the Taliban refrained from attacks against coalition forces; however they increased attacks against (Afghan forces) to levels above seasonal norms,” RS said, according to the report.  Under the deal, US and other foreign forces will quit Afghanistan by July 2021 if the Taliban start peace talks with Kabul and stick to various security commitments.  In the week ahead of the February 29 deal signing in Doha, violence plummeted during a partial truce and US officials hoped attacks would stay low.  Instead, the Taliban immediately resumed assaults on Afghan forces.  During the deal negotiations, the Taliban had agreed to stop hitting foreign troops, but there was no such prohibition on targeting Afghan forces.  RS told Sigar that it chose to restrict data because enemy attacks were now a “critical part” of discussions “regarding ongoing political negotiations between the US and the Taliban.”  Sigar noted the Pentagon said it might release the information in the future.  The move to withhold attack numbers follows a trend of diminishing insights into America's longest war, which the US has given up ever winning and is instead trying to end through a political agreement that will provide face-saving cover to leave Afghanistan.  In 2018, RS stopped providing data on how much of the country the Taliban held or contested, amid criticism the war was mired in an intractable stalemate.  That followed a decision by the Afghan government to classify data on how many of its soldiers and police were getting killed by the Taliban, after shocking figures showed several thousand were dying each year.  Data on enemy attacks “was one of the last remaining metrics Sigar was able to use to report publicly on the security situation in Afghanistan,” the watchdog said.  The Pentagon is on course to cut its troop numbers from about 12,000 to 8,600 in the coming months. — AFP   Related Articles	News
"Harvey accuses government of City of Perth interference as inquiry drags on  01 May 2020, 23:11 by Marta Pascual Juanola  Opposition Leader Liza Harvey has criticised the state government's handling of the scandal-prone City of Perth, accusing it of parachuting in a new chief executive without input from elected councillors.  Ms Harvey said the move risked a return to the problems and instability that had plagued the council for years and sparked the ongoing inquiry.    WA Opposition Leader Liza Harvey. Marta Pascual Juanola   City of Perth commissioners appointed Rottnest Island boss Michelle Reynolds as the council's new chief executive during a special council meeting on Friday last week.  Ms Reynolds, a former chief executive at WorkCover WA with more than two decades' experience as a senior public servant, was appointed by to the Rottnest Island Authority in 2018 amid revelations staff at the authority had been subject to bullying and discrimination.  At the time, Ms Reynolds had been acting in the role for nearly a year, after the government seconded her from WorkCover WA to spearhead a new leadership team to turn the authority around.     Her appointment as the City of Perth's top executive came as a surprise to many, who did not expect a new executive team before the long-awaited October 17 council elections take place.  Ms Harvey accused the McGowan government of interfering in the City of Perth's affairs by putting ""its favoured people into powerful positions without thought for the consequences"".  “The new councillors, if this election ever goes ahead, would have strong opinions on the chief executive who leads the council’s operations and is accountable to the council,"" she said.  ""That’s their job and I would expect them to be diligent to appoint a person they can work closely with to bring Perth out of this crisis.  ""This is a recipe for disaster if the council haven’t got the confidence in the top City official. We risk seeing a repeat of the problems that have plagued this council and pulled the City down for years.""  This is not the first time the the process that led to Ms Reynolds' appointment came under fire this week.  In his column on The West Australian on Friday, mayor hopeful and 6PR breakfast host Basil Zempilas said the appointment of a new chief executive should have been left to the new Lord Mayor and council.  ""So should decisions on the dining room, councillors’ offices and even the mayoral car,"" he said.  Zempilas said it was not in the state government's best interests to limit council's capacity to provide leadership as it led the rejuvenation of the city post-COVID-19.    Basil Zempilas and Steve Mills host 6PR's Breakfast show. IAIN GILLESPIE   But Local Government Minister David Templeman said Ms Reynolds's appointment was the result of an independent selection process and had no government input.  ""It is a matter for the commissioners, so I had no role in it,"" he said.  “Liza Harvey’s claim that the state government has interfered in the chief executive selection process, frankly, does not stand up to scrutiny.”  Ms Harvey's comments come as the long-running inquiry into the City of Perth drags on, with the state government announcing a last-minute two-month extension due to delays caused by the pandemic.  The inquiry is examining whether there were failures to provide good government for the City of Perth community.  It will determine whether there was any ""improper or undue influence"" at the council over ""recruitment, employee management and grants administration"", the relationship between the council and the former chief executive and employees, and sponsorship and gifts.  A long-awaited report containing the findings of the probe was due to be delivered on Thursday, but the government extension means ratepayers will now have to wait until June 30.  Since being appointed in April 2018, the probe has undertaken dozens of public and private hearings and examined more than 100 witnesses as part of 20 different lines of inquiry.  However, Mr Templeman said COVID-19 measures had directly impacted on the inquiry’s work and resulted in inquirer and barrister Tony Power needing more time to finalise the report.  ""[Mr Power] has assured me that the delays caused by COVID-19 were unavoidable,"" he said."	News

Are The Kardashians Going Broke Due To Overspending In The Coronavirus Pandemic?  01 May 2020, 23:00 by Charisse Van Horn  Are the Kardashians going broke due to overspending in the Coronavirus pandemic? That is the subject of an article in the upcoming May 11, 2020, issue of Star magazine. The report comes at a strange time as Forbes named Kylie Jenner, the youngest self-made billionaire for the second year in a row. Even with Kylie’s billion-dollar empire, the source is saying things aren’t looking so hot for the rest of the Kardashians. According to the report, being a Kardashian is rather expensive and they simply aren’t making the same type of money at this point due to the pandemic and are going to have to make some sacrifices soon. The report states that Keeping Up with the Kardashians (KUWK) ratings are down and people simply aren’t buying their products at the rate they used to.  The report even says the family is putting on a brave face in public but really they are all freaking out that their empire is crashing down. The source stated the following.  “Their profits are going down, but their lavish lifestyle is as expensive as ever. It’s been a major reality check for them — and a scary one because they’ve got to start watching every dime.”  You may see some clips from their long-running reality series Keeping Up with the Kardashians (KUWK) below     Some of the expenses that the Kardashians reportedly maintain but are suddenly finding to be burdensome include paying their staff, keeping payments up-to-date on all of their luxury vehicles, and keeping their mansions running in top shape. The source even said that the family is in debt to the tune of $180 million.  No one from the Kardashian or Jenner family has acknowledged the report or indicated they are in financial trouble. The source continued to state the following.  “They have so many properties and the mortgages are sky-high. If things don’t improve, they’re going to have to downsize.”  The source also echoed the suggestion the show may be canceled soon.  “The ratings have been declining for years, and they’re all bracing themselves for a full-blown cancellation.”  At this point, no one knows how long the economy will be in a slump, but with many of the Kardashians running their own businesses and more people facing unemployment, it’s inevitable that all will see their profits plummet during this time.  What do you think about the report? Do you believe the Kardashians are going broke?   Charisse Van Horn is a freelance writer from Tampa Bay.

Salt and Pepper takeaway getting five stars during lockdown  Many Liverpool takeaways remain open during the coronavirus lockdown and this one is proving popular  01 May 2020, 15:00 by Amy Browne  Salt and Pepper takeaway that's been getting five stars during lockdown  With restaurants having been closed across Liverpool for nearly seven weeks now due to the coronavirus lockdown, eating out has become a distant memory.  The good news is that many takeaways have been allowed to remain open for delivery or collection.  And there’s one that’s been getting particularly rave reviews during lockdown , so we decided to put it to the test.  It was the first lockdown takeaway we’ve actually ordered so I was looking forward to a treat - and to not having to cook for a change.  With two children under five and it’s been a hectic few weeks in our house and it’s surprised me how much food we’ve managed to get through, along with cooking, eating and washing up after every meal at home. We were certainly ready for a break from the kitchen.  So having come across the Salt and Pepper House on Booker Avenue in Mossley Hill, and reading its glowing five star reviews on Just Eat, we decided to try it for the first time.  Our postcode is just out of the takeaway’s delivery area, but I was told if I phoned when they opened at 4.30pm I could order for collection at whatever time we wanted.  We did just that and ordered a 7.30pm pick up. The shop front isn’t open, so collection was at the side door and payment by cash only.  Once home and dished up, the food was all still piping hot. To start with we’d ordered the vegetable spring rolls (£2.90), which were a decent size and nice and crispy on the outside. We’d also ordered the salt and pepper ribs (£5.50), which ended up being the highlight of the whole meal. The seasoning was perfect and the ribs meaty, and there were plenty of them to share between two.     Onto the mains and we tucked into the king prawn chilli and garlic with noodles (£7.10) and duck with green peppers and black bean sauce with fried rice (£7.30).  The prawns were huge and juicy and the chilli sauce had a nice kick. The noodles were a bit on the dry side, so needed the sauce from the main dish.  The duck was nice and tender and unlike the noodles, the fried rice was a lovely fluffy texture and enjoyable to eat with or without the sauce.  The portions were huge, meaning we had leftovers to tuck into the next day, which is always a guilty pleasure of mine.  Overall I was really impressed with the food; it didn’t leave a greasy taste and it all looked and tasted fresh.  The Salt and Pepper House is definitely worthy of the impressive reviews it's been receiving, and we’ll certainly be ordering from there again, probably even before lockdown is over.	News
Paul Giamatti Says He Used ‘Hardass’ John Durham to Inform Billions Character  01 May 2020, 12:42 by Matt Naham     Hollywood star Paul Giamatti revealed an interesting truth about certain real life U.S. Attorneys who informed the character of fictional U.S. Attorney-turned-New York Attorney General Chuck Rhoades in Showtime’s Billions .  In an interview with GQ on Friday, Giamatti answered questions on a range of topics, many of the related to the show Billions , of which there are five seasons . Reporter Gabriella Paiella noted that the Rhoades character is “very loosely based on Preet Bharara.” Preet Bharara is the former U.S. Attorney for the Southern District of New York who was famously fired by President Donald Trump .  Law&Crime’s Elura Nanos noted the Billions connection before in the context of Bharara’s firing :  During his almost eight-year tenure, Bharara most notably wielded the full power of the S.D.N.Y. against SAC Capital Advisors for insider trading, shutting down the hedge fund, and winning a $1.8 billion settlement . Bharara’s aggressive prosecution of SAC Capital was not only a media event, but also inspired the hit Showtime drama Billions , starring Paul Giamatti as a Bharara-derivative aggressive U.S. Attorney for the Southern District of N.Y.  As it turns out, though, Bharara is not the only U.S. Attorney to have some influence on the Rhoades character. The Q&A in which Giamatti briefly discussed “hardass” U.S. Attorney for the District of Connecticut John Durham’s past:   Q: I know Chuck is very loosely based on Preet Bharara. But, as his political aspirations grew over the course of the show and he ran for various offices, were there any politicians who you used to inform the character?  A: There was a guy that was interesting to me early on, and his name is John Durham. And he’s actually the guy who William Barr tagged to do the investigation of the Russia investigation. He used to be the federal attorney for the state of Connecticut and he’s a pretty intense guy. He’s one of the guys who brought down Whitey Bulger, but he also took down the FBI guys who were colluding with Whitey Bulger. I thought there were a lot of things about him that were interesting. The way he looks, too, is interesting. If you look him up you can see.  Q: Oh yeah.  A: You see him? He doesn’t look like what you normally think these guys are gonna look like, and he’s a tough guy, too. He’s a hardass.   Durham has, indeed, been investigating the Russiagate investigators since Attorney General William Barr  assigned him to do so in May 2019 . The investigation has since turned into a criminal probe.  Barr hasn’t ruled out indictments dropping before the 2020 election.  President Trump nominated Durham, a Department of Justice attorney since 1982, to be the U.S. Attorney in Connecticut in 2017. Despite being a Trump appointee, Durham was recommended for the position by Connecticut’s Democratic senators Richard Blumenthal and Chris Murphy who characterized him as having earned “immense respect as a no-nonsense, fierce and fair prosecutor.” He was unanimously confirmed by the Senate on a voice vote in early 2018.  Durham was first appointed as a special prosecutor by President Bill Clinton ‘s Attorney General Janet Reno in 1999 to investigate law enforcement corruption in Boston centered around the F.B.I.’s treatment of notorious mobster James “Whitey” Bulger .  In 2008, President George W. Bush’s Attorney General Michael Mukasey tapped Durham to lead the investigation into the treatment of CIA detainees and the destruction of videotapes showing the torture of terrorism suspects. In 2009, President Barack Obama ‘s Attorney General Eric H. Holder expanded the scope of Durham’s inquiry into investigating whether the CIA’s abuse of detainees violated any laws.  By 2010, we learned that Durham “concluded that he [would] not pursue criminal charges for the destruction of the interrogation videotapes.”   Jerry Lambe contributed to this report.

"Joe Biden: alleged sexual assault 'never happened'  (UPDATED) 'They aren't true. This never happened,' Joe Biden says in a statement regarding the accusations made by Tara Reade, a former staffer in his US Senate office  01 May 2020, 12:52 by Agence France-Presse    BIDEN. In this file photo taken on March 10, 2020, Democratic presidential hopeful Joe Biden leaves after speaking at the National Constitution Center in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. File photo by Mandel Ngan/AFP   WASHINGTON, DC, USA (UPDATED) – US presidential candidate Joe Biden on Friday, May 1, emphatically denied sexually assaulting a former staffer, saying the incident she claims occurred 27 years ago ""never happened.""  ""They aren't true. This never happened,"" Biden said in a statement regarding the accusations made by Tara Reade, a former staffer in his US Senate office.  Biden, the presumptive Democratic presidential nominee, broke a month of silence on the accusations with his statement.  The 77-year-old said Reade's then-supervisor and former senior staffers in his office ""have said, unequivocally, that she never came to them and complained or raised issues.""  Reade said on a podcast in March that then-senator Biden sexually assaulted her in a Capitol Hill corridor in 1993, when she was 29.  He pinned her against a wall when she brought him a gym bag, put his hands ""down my skirt"" and violated her, said Reade, now 56.  She has since recounted her story to other media outlets, and filed an incident report with the Washington police in early April in which she did not name Biden.  Other women have accused the former vice president of touching them inappropriately in the past, and Reade's initial claims were similar -- and less severe than her most recent allegations.  Biden went on a morning news show to publicly address the claims.  ""It is not true. I'm saying unequivocally it never happened, and it didn't,"" Biden told MSNBC.  ""I don't know why after 27 years all of this gets raised,"" Biden added. ""But I'm not going to question her motive. I'm not going to attack her.""  But he stressed that ""I have a right to say, look at the facts. Check it out.""  Reade has not produced a copy of the complaint that she allegedly filed in 1993.  Biden, calling for transparency, said he has asked officials to search the National Archives, where he says any such document would now reside.  ""There's nothing for me to hide,"" he said.  Biden, however, resisted the idea of calling for a search among his Senate papers, which were donated to the University of Delaware, which is his home state.  Those documents ""do not contain personnel files,"" he said.  Biden, who has pledged to pick a woman to be his vice president, stressed that he has worked his entire political career to improve conditions for women, including authoring the Violence Against Women Act.  He was also asked by MSNBC about comments he made during the 2018 controversial Supreme Court confirmation process for Brett Kavanaugh, who had been accused of sexual assault.  Biden said at the time that when a woman comes forward with such accusations, ""you've got to start off with the presumption that at least the essence of what she's talking about is real.""  Asked what made things different now, Biden stressed: ""Women are to be believed, given the benefit of the doubt, if they come forward and say something happened to them.""  ""Then you have to look at the circumstances and the facts,"" he added.  ""The truth matters,"" he said. ""These claims are not true.""  President Donald Trump, who faces Biden in the November election, faced more than a dozen accusations of sexual harassment and assault before he became president. – Rappler.com"	News
"Lockdown led to subdued economic activity but saved India from lot of agony, says Rajnish Kumar  01 May 2020, 12:44 by PTI   ""More patience is required. We cannot lower the guard without being confident that we are in complete control of the situation and the spread of the virus is fully contained,"" the top SBI official told   The coronavirus-triggered lockdown has saved the country from ""a lot of agony"", notwithstanding the subdued economic activity during the period, State Bank of India (SBI) Chairman Rajnish Kumar said on Friday.  He said the nationwide lockdown should only be lifted once the situation is fully under control.  ""More patience is required. We cannot lower the guard without being confident that we are in complete control of the situation and the spread of the virus is fully contained,"" the top SBI official told PTI.  ""I think the lockdown has saved India from a lot of agony and the number of cases is under control,"" he said.  Kumar said as long as the lockdown continues, economic activity will remain tepid, but ""demand should be there in the economy"" and the question of logistics can be taken care of.  The SBI chairman also said the complete easing of the curbs is still some time away.  ""I think we are few days away when the lockdown can be completely lifted. Some states are in a bad shape. It also has to be ensured that the number of green zones across the country increases,"" he said.  Kumar said if people continue to maintain discipline during the lockdown, the curve can be flattened quickly and an exponential rise in the number of coronavirus cases prevented.  ""We are getting results, as the recovery rate is more than 25 per cent,"" he added.

"Laid-off employees reluctant to return to reopened jobs may lose unemployment benefits  01 May 2020, 13:02 by Peter Weber  Several states are lifting their COVID-19 mitigation orders Friday, allowing many businesses to reopen, usually with some health precautions in place. In Georgia, for example, Gov. Brian Kemp (R) is lifting shelter-in-place orders for most of the state, even with 37 new coronavirus deaths and 227 new cases reported in the past 24 hours. In Texas, where Gov. Greg Abbott (R) is allowing restaurants, movie theaters, and retail stores to reopen at 25 percent capacity, a record 50 deaths and 1,033 new cases of COVID-19 were registered Thursday.  The businesses that choose to reopen need workers, and the workers being called back to their jobs face some tough choices .  Some states, most with Republican governors, have underscored that laid-off or furloughed employees who refuse to return to work will be aggressively barred from collecting unemployment benefits. ""That's a voluntary quit,"" said Iowa Gov. Kim Reynolds (R). ""Therefore, they would not be eligible for the unemployment money."" In Oklahoma, where the minimum wage is $7.25, state economic officials encouraged employers to report unwilling workers and discussed scrapping the federal $600-a-week unemployment add-on to encourage people to return to work.  ""These states are offering people the choice to endanger your life or starve,"" says the AFL-CIO's Damon Silvers.  Texas announced Thursday it will relax its unemployment rules so people at high risk of dying from COVID-19, workers who live with high-risk people, or those without child care can still collect unemployment benefits. But everyone else faces some hard choices, especially in the food service industry, as ProPublica 's Jessica Huseman explains.     Texas businesses are making it easier for some workers. None of the major movie chains are reopening — they have no new movies to show, Texas Monthly notes — and some smaller and independent restaurants are opting to keep their dining rooms closed rather than reopen with 25 percent of seats. ""All restaurants are not created equal as far as ability to generate revenue,"" Emily Williams Knight, head of the Texas Restaurant Association, tells The Texas Tribune .

Top CBB Transfer’s Comment About Kentucky Fans Is Going Viral  01 May 2020, 13:54 by Andrew McCarty  Early Friday morning college basketball’s transfer market received arguably its best player since the close of the 2019-20 season.  Wake Forest center Olivier Sarr announced he is entering the transfer portal. The move comes after the Demon Deacons decided to fire head coach Danny Manning and replace him with Steve Forbes this week.  Immediately after his decision to transfer became known, one college team’s fans flocked to social media. Kentucky fans clamored for Sarr to transfer to the SEC powerhouse.  The former Demon Deacons star said he’s never experience anything like that from fans. However, he also said it was a little bit too much.  Here’s what he had to say, via ESPN :  “I’ve never experienced anything like that; it was crazy,” he said. “It was funny and all that, but it got to a point where it was a little bit too much. Some Wake fans replied. I loved the loyalty from the Deacon fans. I love them, I appreciate what they did for me for three years. But Kentucky fans are really eager and thirsty for players.”  Coach John Calipari and the Wildcats missed out on Purdue transfer Matt Haarms earlier this offseason.  Now it looks like Sarr could be the team’s main target. He averaged 13.7 points and 9.0 rebounds per game and posted 11 double-doubles in the 2019-20 season.  Where will Sarr land?	News
"New car sales crash as Covid-19 puts brakes on market  01 May 2020, 13:41 by Justin Kelly  The Society of the Irish Motor Industry (SIMI) today released their official new vehicle statistics.  New car registrations for April declined 96.1% (344) when compared to April 2019 (8,904). As a result of COVID-19 retailer’s showrooms have remained closed since Mid-March, impacting heavily on sales. Registrations year to date are down 30.7% (50,626) on the same period last year (73,030).  The commercial vehicle sector is also feeling the impact of closures, with Light Commercials vehicles (LCV) down 87.3% (229) compared to April last year (1,799) and year to date are down 25.3% (9,603). HGV (Heavy Goods Vehicle) registrations are down 67.8% (98) in comparison to April 2019 (304). Year to date HGV's are down 9.9% (1,070).  Used car imports for April (199) seen a decrease of 97.8% on April 2019 (8,887). While year to date imports are down 50.5% (17,669) on 2019 (35,719).  Brian Cooke, SIMI Director General commenting on the market figures said: “Like many other sectors of the economy, COVID-19 is having a devastating impact on the Irish Motor Industry. SIMI Members have during the course of the lockdown to date, been available to assist in emergency and essential call outs. We continue to play our part in keeping vital goods and services moving.  ""However, the registration numbers underline the lack of activity in new vehicle sales, and this is replicated for used cars and servicing. While the short-term outlook for the Irish economy is bleak, once the health situation allows the Motor Industry is ready to get back to work.  ""Members have used this downtime to implement measures, in accordance with both Industry and State guidelines, that will protect both their employees and customers against the spread of COVID-19. The size of dealerships and the average footfall, for both sales and servicing, lends itself to social distancing. While santisation measures being put in place for both premises and vehicles, means that safety and protection are at the top of the agenda.  ""With the July registration period approaching, the Motor Industry will be well placed to help start activity in the Irish economy. This has the potential to protect the nearly 50,000 people in employment in the sector, increasing Government Revenues, improving the safety of the cars on Irish roads, while also improving Ireland’s environmental performance by replacing old cars with new or newer cars.  ""In this context, continuation of the current supports and cash flow benefits from Revenue will be important, while additional measures such as the cancelling of rates bills, and reductions in VAT and VRT would be very helpful as would the immediate re-opening of NCT and commercial vehicle test centres.”"	News

"Railways to charge states for ferrying migrant workers during lockdown  01 May 2020, 14:40 by PTI     New Delhi, May 01 : The railways will charge state governments for ferrying people stranded due to the coronavirus-triggered lockdown in its 'Shramik Special' trains, according to an order issued on Friday.     The fare would include cost of sleeper class ticket, superfast charge of Rs 30 and Rs 20 for meals and water per passenger. After more than a month of suspension of services, the railways on Friday, which is also International Labour Day, announced six ""Shramik Special"" trains for migrant workers, students and others who were stranded due to the lockdown.  The first such service was run with 1,200 passengers from Hyderabad to Jharkhand at 4:50 am on Friday.  The other five which are scheduled to run include -- Nasik to Lucknow (at 9:30 pm), Aluva to Bhubaneswar (6 pm), Nasik to Bhopal (8 pm), Jaipur to Patna and Kota to Hatia (9 pm). Each train is expected to carry 1,000-1,200 passengers. ""Passengers need not buy anything from the railways. State governments will coordinate and pay on their behalf,"" the railways said.  Thousands of migrants were stranded in places across the country since the lockdown was enforced on March 25, many even attempting to walk home hundreds of kilometres away. On Friday, the Ministry of Home Affairs gave permission to the railways to run special trains for migrants and those stranded in different parts of the country.  States like Rajasthan, Jharkhand, Bihar, Kerala, Maharashtra, Odisha, Uttar Pradesh, Punjab and Telangana have requested special trains to ferry migrant workers back to their home states.  ""As per the guidelines issued by the Ministry of Home Affairs, it has been decided to run 'Shramik Special' trains from 'Labour Day' today to move migrant workers, pilgrims, tourists, students and other persons stranded at different places due to the lockdown.  ""These special trains will be run from point to point on the request of both the state governments concerned as per the standard protocols for sending and receiving such stranded persons. The railways and state governments shall appoint senior officials as nodal officers for coordination and a smooth operation of these 'Shramik Specials',"" the national transporter said.  Officials said that a list of hundreds of such services have been planned by zonal railways over the coming days. The railways also clarified that that these are special trains planned for nominated people identified and registered by state governments.  ""No one under any circumstance should come to Railway station looking for trains. We will not issue any tickets to any individual or entertain any request from any group or individual. We will allow only those passengers to board whom state govt officials will bring to Railway Stations. ""State government is the final authority to decide that who will travel in our trains,"" a railways spokesperson said."	News
Iftar crowds go missing under lockdown shadow in Dhaka  01 May 2020, 22:20 by bdnews24.com     Chawkbazar looked almost deserted on the first day of Ramadan amid the coronavirus shutdown. Every year, the biggest Iftar market of Dhaka bustles with shoppers and sellers here.        The restaurants and makeshift food shops draw huge crowds in Dhaka before Iftar during Ramadan every year, but the coronavirus pandemic and the resultant lockdown to slow it have changed it all.   The month of Ramadan has arrived in Bangladesh amidst unprecedented curbs on public movement and trade as a vast number of the population are staying at home to avoid infection.  Though the government has eased the lockdown, allowing the restaurants to sell Iftar delicacies and other shops to remain open for two more hours, most eateries are closed.  The restaurateurs say they have suffered the setback due to staffing shortage and the ban on display of Iftar foods on pavements.  The police said everyone must follow physical distancing rules while buying Iftar and cannot eat at the restaurants.  Khandaker Ruhul Amin, the president of Bangladesh Restaurant Owners’ Association, said, “Our staff have left. And we can only sell takeaways. These are some of the reasons why many are not reopening business.”  “And we can’t attract the customers without displaying the food. How many people would buy parcelled food? Public movement is also low due to the coronavirus,” he said.  Nearly 97 percent of the around 8,000 restaurants in the capital have remained shut amid the lockdown, according to Ruhul Amin.     Some shops in Bailey Road and Gulshan have reopened, but the ones that sell famous traditional items in Old Dhaka drawing food lovers from across the city are closed.  Ruhul Amin said they asked the employees not to rejoin their job if the situation does not improve. “What if they catch coronavirus on the way and spread it?” he asked.  Another restaurateur said he kept his business closed because it would count losses if it sold only Iftar items.  “Maybe we can pay for the ingredients, but how would we pay the wages and allowances?” he asked.  Md Zinnat, the owner of Zinnat Hotel and Restaurant in Noyabazar, said none of his 26 staff members want to get back to work.  Md Faruk, the owner of Shahjahan Bakery, said he retained only five of his 40 staff to make breads and biscuits.  “We used to make 60 bakery products and 15 Iftar items,” he said.  Chawkbazar’s Shahi Iftar Bazar, where thousands of people gather daily during Ramadan, is forlorn.  Only Alauddin Sweetmeat has reopened to sell some items, but no shop near the Shahi Mosque resumed business.  “We’ve asked the restaurants to sell Iftar items, but none of them agrees. Some don’t have employees while some others give different reasons,” Chawkbazar Police Station OC Moudut Howlader said.  Bongshal Police Station OC Shahin Fakir said all the restaurants, including famous eatery Razzak Hotel, have remained closed.	News

SC notice to Maharashtra govt on Palghar case  The PIL filed through advocate Rahul Bansal questioned how a large number of people had gathered at the spot, despite the lockdown, on April 16, before killing two sadhus and their driver.  01 May 2020, 22:31 by Express News Service    Issuing a notice to the state government, a bench of justices Ashok Bhushan and Sanjiv Khanna fixed the matter for hearing after four weeks. The present investigation by the CID into the case will continue.   The Supreme Court Friday sought a status report from the Maharashtra government on a PIL questioning the role of the police in the Palghar lynching case and seeking a CBI probe into the episode. The PIL filed through advocate Rahul Bansal questioned how a large number of people had gathered at the spot, despite the lockdown, on April 16, before killing two sadhus and their driver. Issuing a notice to the state government, a bench of justices Ashok Bhushan and Sanjiv Khanna fixed the matter for hearing after four weeks. The present investigation by the CID into the case will continue. The PIL contended that the mob had started thrashing the sadhus, Chikne Maharaj Kalpavrukshagiri (70), Sushilgiri Maharaj Kalpavrukshagiri (35) and their driver, Nilesh Telgare (30), with sticks, rods and knives in the presence of the police. The three were travelling in a car from Mumbai to Surat, in Gujarat to attend a funeral. “During this whole incident, the police didn’t take any concrete step to protect these innocent men which could be proved by the fact that they didn’t use any force to disperse the crowd. One of the videos shows one of the police personnel actually pushing the saints to the crowd when they were asking for protection,” the PIL claimed, and sought an investigation by either the CBI probe or a court-monitored Special Investigation Team. The counsel said the lynching had occurred despite the fact that the whole country was under lockdown since March 25 “…which raises huge suspicion on part of local police.” The plea also requested the court to transfer the trial to a Delhi court.
